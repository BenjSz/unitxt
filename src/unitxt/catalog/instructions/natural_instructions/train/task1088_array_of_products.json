    "text": "You are given a list of integers. A list is shown by comma-separated numbers between two brackets. For example, [7,3,6] is a list. The number in location one is 7, the number in location two is 3, and the number in location three is 6. You should answer with a list such that every element at each location is equal to the product of elements at every other location in the input array. For example, if a list has four numbers, the answer you give should be created like this: First element of your list = product of second, third, and fourth elements in the given list. Second element of your list = product of First, third and fourth elements in the given list, etc."
