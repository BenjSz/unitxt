The index of an elements shows its numerical order in the list(for example, in the list [7,10,4,5], the index of 7 is 1 and the index of 4 is 3)  You should start the index at 1, so the first element in the list will be subtracted by one. For every element in the list you need to find \"element - index\" where the index of the beginning element is 1 and increments by 1 for each element. Put your result list in brackets."
