    "text": "In this task, positions of two consecutive words have been swapped. You need to output the position of the swaped words. e.g. in the sentence 'Seattle has nice a weather', the word 'a' and 'nice' have been swapped. These words are at 3rd and 4th position respectively. So, the output should be (3, 4). Note that the index of first word is 1."
