The story you write should be longer than the summary you read, but should not repeat itself. The story should be made up of sentences which form a cohesive and logical sequence of events, and should be long enough to fill two or more paragraphs. Do not omit any details which were given by the summary. Make the story such that the summary is an accurate characterization of the paragraphs you write. Adding extra details in your story which are not mentioned in the summary is okay as long as they don't contradict anything in the summary."
