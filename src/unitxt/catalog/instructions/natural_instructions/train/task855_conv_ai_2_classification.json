    "text": "Read an exchange between SENDER A and SENDER B, and answer whether SENDER A is a 'Bot' or a 'Human'. There are only a maximum of two senders (A and B) per conversation, and there are no conversations where SENDER A and SENDER B are both bots, or both humans; only one sender per conversation can be a bot, and only one can be a human. Knowing this, need only to classify whether SENDER A is 'Human' or 'Bot'; you do not need to write anything about SENDER B. Typically, bots will have a more disjointed manner of speaking, and will make statements that don't relate to each other, don't make coherent sense, or otherwise appear unnatural. Humans will make statements in a more or less coherent and logical way, potentially including asking the bot why the bot is not making sense or contradicting itself."
