    "text": "You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph. You need to come up with a question about the story that requires an understanding of the relationship described in the background paragraph. The generated question should not be answerable without both the background and story. Write a question about the story that requires a relationship in the background paragraph to answer. Check whether your question requires both the background paragraph and the story to answer. If your question can be answered by only one of these, try to rewrite your question so that it requires both. Note that \"flipping\" a word in the question can give rise to a new question where the answer will be different from the original question. Often, \"flipping\" a word gives rise to flipping the direction of the relationship, for example, from \"increase\" to \"decrease.\""
