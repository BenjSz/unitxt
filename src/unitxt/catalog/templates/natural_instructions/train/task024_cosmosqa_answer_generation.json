Make sure your correct answer is reasonably long, consistent with the context, and requires common sense (instead of explicit extraction from the context.) In your answer, use as few words as possible from the given context. Use a response that is uncommon/non-stereotypical, so that it is less predictable. To be less repetitive, please vary your language for each question.\n\n##Input: {input}\n\n##Output: ",
