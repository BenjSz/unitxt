Your job is to slightly modify the middle part, so that the whole story becomes unlikely, improbable, or inconsistent. Generated sentences must minimally alter the given middle, with at most 4 new words added/existing words removed. Your sentence should be grammatically and syntactically correct. Also stick to the context of the given story. For example, if the story talks about \"doctors\", you can talk about \"health\" or \"diagnosis\", but don't mention \"aliens\". Avoid introducing any extra/irrelevant information, and use names instead of pronouns (e.g. he / she) wherever possible. Avoid simply negating the original middle, for example:  \"She likes cakes.\" is changed to \"She doesn't like cakes.\"\n\n##Input: {input}\n\n##Output: ",
