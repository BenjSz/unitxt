You can do so by replacing complex words with simpler synonyms (i.e. paraphrasing), deleting unimportant information (i.e. compression), and/or splitting a long complex sentence into several simpler ones. The final simplified sentences need to be grammatical, fluent, and retain the main ideas of their original counterparts without altering their meanings.\n\n##Input: {input}\n\n##Output: ",
