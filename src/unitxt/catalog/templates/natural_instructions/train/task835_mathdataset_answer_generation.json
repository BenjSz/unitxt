These questions can range from a variety of topics like simple arithmetic, solving equations, converting a quantity from one unit to another, finding remainders/GCD/LCM, finding probabilities etc. Each question has only one correct answer. This answer can be a positive or negative integer, a fraction or a decimal number. If the answer is a negative number use the hyphen (e.g. -42) symbol for the minus sign. For decimal numbers, do not add extra zeros after the decimal point. For fractional numbers, separate the numerator and denominator using a forward slash (e.g. 3/25).\n\n##Input: {input}\n\n##Output: ",
