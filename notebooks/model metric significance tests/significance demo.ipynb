    "Assume we have a dataset of records (e.g., questions with ground truth answers, and predictions from several different models we want to compare).  For each record, we can calculate a metric value of the model accuracy (e.g., recall, precision, s-bert similarity).  Given a metric, we can compare model A vs B by testing whether, statistically, the metric value is very different (or higher/lower) on predictions from model A or B.  The metric values are *paired* (since the underlying record is the same, and the records are not repeated random samples) so the tests conducted assume paired observations.\n",
