Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: The ground tissue of plants includes all tissues that are neither dermal nor vascular . It can be divided into three classes based on the nature of the cell walls . Parenchyma cells have thin primary walls and usually remain alive after they become mature . Parenchyma forms the `` filler '' tissue in the soft parts of plants. usually present in cortex , pericycle , pith , and medullary rays in primary stem and root . Collenchyma cells have thin primary walls with some areas of secondary thickening . Collenchyma provides extra structural support , particularly in regions of new growth . Sclerenchyma cells have thick lignified secondary walls and often die when mature . Sclerenchyma provides the main structural support to a plant .

Context: Seasonality is a characteristic of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes which recur every calendar year . Any predictable change or pattern in a time series that recurs or repeats over a one - year period can be said to be seasonal . It is common in many situations -- such as grocery store or even in a Medical Examiner 's office -- that the demand depends on the day of the week . In such situations , the forecasting procedure calculates the seasonal index of the `` season '' -- seven seasons , one for each day -- which is the ratio of the average demand of that season ( which is calculated by Moving Average or Exponential Smoothing using historical data corresponding only to that season ) to the average demand across all seasons . An index higher than 1 indicates that demand is higher than average ; an index less than 1 indicates that the demand is less than the average . 
Question: which method of forecasting uses averages to predict future weather.
Response:","['Seasonality, in which data experiences regular and predictable changes which recur every calendar year, is the method of forecasting, where averages are used to calculate the seasonal index of the season.']","Moving Average or Exponential Smoothing using historical data corresponding only to that season

Context: With a worldwide box - office gross of over $2.7 billion , Avatar is often proclaimed to be the `` highest - grossing '' film , but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income , which can form a significant portion of a film 's earnings . Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful . Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals , in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters . While complete sales data are not available for Avatar , it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu - ray units in North America , and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu - ray units worldwide . After home video income is accounted for , both films have earned over $3 billion . Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film 's earnings , with a film often earning as much as 20 -- 25 % of its theatrical box - office for a couple of television runs on top of pay - per - view revenues ; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights , equating to about 9 % of its North American gross .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: Insulin ( from Latin insula , island ) is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreatic islets ; it is considered to be the main anabolic hormone of the body . It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates , fats and protein by promoting the absorption of , especially glucose from the blood into liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells . In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen via glycogenesis or fats ( triglycerides ) via lipogenesis , or , in the case of the liver , into both . Glucose production and secretion by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood . Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues . It is therefore an anabolic hormone , promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules inside the cells . Low insulin levels in the blood have the opposite effect by promoting widespread catabolism , especially of reserve body fat . 
Question: what is the function of insulin and where is it produced.

It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and protein by promoting the absorption of, especially glucose from the blood into liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.  Glucose production and secretion by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood.  Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules inside the cells.']","Insulin ( from Latin insula , island ) is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreatic islets ; it is considered to be the main anabolic hormone of the body . It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates , fats and protein by promoting the absorption of , especially glucose from the blood into liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells . In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen via glycogenesis or fats ( triglycerides ) via lipogenesis , or , in the case of the liver , into both . Glucose production and secretion by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood . Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues . It is therefore an anabolic hormone , promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules inside the cells . Low insulin levels in the blood have the opposite effect by promoting widespread catabolism , especially of reserve body fat .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: Frank was a prolific author , writing 40 books . He published widely on political economy , economic history , international relations , historical sociology , and world history . Perhaps his most notable work is Capitalism and Underdevelopment in Latin America . Published in 1967 , it was one of the formative texts in dependency theory . In his later career he produced works such as ReOrient : Global Economy in the Asian Age and , with Barry Gills , The World System : Five Hundred Years or Five Thousand . Frank 's theories center on the idea that a nation 's economic strength , largely determined by historical circumstances -- especially geography -- dictates its global power . He is also well known for suggesting that purely export oriented solutions to development create imbalances detrimental to poor countries . Frank has made significant contributions to the world - systems theory ( which , according to him , should be rather called the World System one ) . He has argued that a World System was formed no later than in the 4th millennium BC ; his argument contrasts sharply with the scholarly majority who posit beginnings in the `` long 16th century '' ( a position held , for example , by Immanuel Wallerstein ) . Frank also insisted that the idea of numerous `` world - systems '' did not make much sense ( indeed , if there are many `` world - systems '' in the world , then they simply do not deserve to be called `` world - systems '' ) , and we should rather speak about one single World System .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: The 20th century was the most violent century in all of human history . It started with World War I ( 1914 -- 1918 ) , which is often referred to as the `` Great War '' or `` War to End All Wars '', but it did not end all wars . Just twenty years later , another world war began. This time, World War II ( 1939 -- 1945 ) was more destructive than its predecessor. The first use of nuclear weapons against a populated area occurred during this war . The aftermath of the two world wars led to the Cold War ( 1947 -- 1991 ) , which was a state of political and military tension between powers in the Western Bloc and those in the Eastern Bloc . During this time period, both sides had the capacity to totally destroy each other with their nuclear arsenals. Although the cold war was not fought directly between these two blocs, many proxy wars were fought , including the Korean War ( 1950 -- 1953 ) and the Vietnam War ( 1955 -- 1975 ). The final decade of the 20th century saw an end to this era of global conflict.

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: The ground tissue of plants includes all tissues that are neither dermal nor vascular . It can be divided into three classes based on the nature of the cell walls . Parenchyma cells have thin primary walls and usually remain alive after they become mature . Parenchyma forms the `` filler '' tissue in the soft parts of plants. usually present in cortex , pericycle , pith , and medullary rays in primary stem and root . Collenchyma cells have thin primary walls with some areas of secondary thickening . Collenchyma provides extra structural support , particularly in regions of new growth . Sclerenchyma cells have thick lignified secondary walls and often die when mature . Sclerenchyma provides the main structural support to a plant .

Context: A likely and documented explanation is that the term is derived from the `` dead horse '' ritual of seamen ( see Beating a dead horse ) . In this practice , the seaman paraded a straw - stuffed effigy of a horse around the deck before throwing it overboard . Seamen were paid partly in advance before a long voyage , and they frequently spent their pay all at once , resulting in a period of time without income . If they got advances from the ship 's paymaster , they would incur debt . This period was called the `` dead horse '' time , and it usually lasted a month or two . The seaman 's ceremony was to celebrate having worked off the `` dead horse '' debt . As west - bound shipping from Europe usually reached the subtropics at about the time the `` dead horse '' was worked off , the latitude became associated with the ceremony .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: The main purpose of a myelin sheath is to increase the speed at which impulses propagate along the myelinated fiber . Along unmyelinated fibers , impulses continuously move as waves , but , in myelinated fibers , they `` hop '' or propagate by saltatory conduction . Myelin decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance across the cell membrane ( the axolemma ) . Thus , myelination prevents the electric current from leaving the axon . It has been suggested that myelin permits larger body size by maintaining agile communication between distant body parts .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: With a worldwide box - office gross of over $2.7 billion , Avatar is often proclaimed to be the `` highest - grossing '' film , but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income , which can form a significant portion of a film 's earnings . Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful . Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals , in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters . While complete sales data are not available for Avatar , it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu - ray units in North America , and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu - ray units worldwide . After home video income is accounted for , both films have earned over $3 billion . Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film 's earnings , with a film often earning as much as 20 -- 25 % of its theatrical box - office for a couple of television runs on top of pay - per - view revenues ; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights , equating to about 9 % of its North American gross .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life . 
Question: where are genes located what are their functions.

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life . 
Question: where are genes located what are their functions.

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another . This law applies to all processes , both natural and man made . It implies that the total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant , although it may change forms . For example , if a gas is compressed , the heat given off during compression can be used as a source of heat for another process . The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system will always increase over time . Entropy is a measure of the number of specific ways in which a system may be arranged , often taken to be a measure of disorder or randomness . A simple illustration of this concept is the mixing of hot and cold water . If you have two containers of water -- one boiling hot and one very cold -- and you mix them together , the temperature of the water becomes much closer to room temperature than either of the starting temperatures . In other words, the energy has become more diffuse or disordered . The second law also implies that natural processes tend toward equilibrium , as they move from a less probable state to a more probable one .

Context: The origin of the person of Jonas Bronck ( c. 1600 -- 43 ) is contested . Some sources claim he was a Swedish born emigrant from Komstad , Norra Ljunga parish in Småland , Sweden , who arrived in New Netherland during the spring of 1639 . Bronck became the first recorded European settler in the area now known as the Bronx and built a farm named `` Emmanus '' close to what today is the corner of Willis Avenue and 132nd Street in Mott Haven . He leased land from the Dutch West India Company on the neck of the mainland immediately north of the Dutch settlement in Harlem ( on Manhattan Island ) , and bought additional tracts from the local tribes . He eventually accumulated 500 acres ( 200 ha ) between the Harlem River and the Aquahung , which became known as Bronck 's River or the Bronx ( River ) . Dutch and English settlers referred to the area as Bronck 's Land . The American poet William Bronk was a descendant of Pieter Bronck , either Jonas Bronck 's son or his younger brother . More recent research indicates that Pieter was probably Jonas ' nephew or cousin , but certainly of the same family .

Context: The cell membrane ( also known as the plasma membrane or cytoplasmic membrane , and historically referred to as the plasmalemma ) is a biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment ( the extracellular space ) . It consists of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins . The basic function of the cell membrane is to protect the cell from its surroundings . The cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of cells and organelles . In this way , it is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules . In addition , cell membranes are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell adhesion , ion conductivity and cell signalling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures , including the cell wall , the carbohydrate layer called the glycocalyx , and the intracellular network of protein fibers called the cytoskeleton . In the field of synthetic biology , cell membranes can be artificially reassembled .

Context: With a worldwide box - office gross of over $2.7 billion , Avatar is often proclaimed to be the `` highest - grossing '' film , but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income , which can form a significant portion of a film 's earnings . Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful . Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals , in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters . While complete sales data are not available for Avatar , it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu - ray units in North America , and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu - ray units worldwide . After home video income is accounted for , both films have earned over $3 billion . Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film 's earnings , with a film often earning as much as 20 -- 25 % of its theatrical box - office for a couple of television runs on top of pay - per - view revenues ; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights , equating to about 9 % of its North American gross .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: The world 's first movable type printing press technology for printing paper books was made of porcelain materials and was invented around AD 1040 in China during the Northern Song Dynasty by the inventor Bi Sheng ( 990 -- 1051 ) . Subsequently in 1377 , the world 's oldest extant movable metal print book , Jikji , was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty . Because of this , the diffusion of both movable - type systems was , to some degree , limited to primarily East Asia , although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries , traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe . Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others . Around 1450 Johannes Gutenberg , introduced the metal movable - type printing press in Europe , along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould . The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor . Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead , tin , and antimony -- and these materials remained standard for 550 years .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: In economics , tax incidence or tax burden is the analysis of the effect of a particular tax on the distribution of economic welfare . The introduction of a tax drives a wedge between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive for a product , which typically imposes an economic burden on both producers and consumers .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life . 
Question: where are genes located what are their functions.

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was. A first-class Canadian passenger, Mrs. Vera Dick, and several other passengers, alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer, My God, to Thee.'' Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship, `` Nearer, My God, to Thee'' would be one of the songs he would play. But Walter Lord's book A Night to Remember popularized wireless operator Harold Bride's 1912 account (New York Times) that he heard the song `` Autumn'' before the ship sank. It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as ``Autumn'' or the tune of the then-popular waltz ``Songe d'Automne,'' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band. Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band, as he floated off the deck before the ship went down. Some consider his statement to be reliable. Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band's final moments. The notion that the band played ``Nearer, My God, to Thee'' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia, which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick's recollection.

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: With a worldwide box - office gross of over $2.7 billion , Avatar is often proclaimed to be the `` highest - grossing '' film , but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income , which can form a significant portion of a film 's earnings . Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful . Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals , in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters . While complete sales data are not available for Avatar , it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu - ray units in North America , and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu - ray units worldwide . After home video income is accounted for , both films have earned over $3 billion . Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film 's earnings , with a film often earning as much as 20 -- 25 % of its theatrical box - office for a couple of television runs on top of pay - per - view revenues ; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights , equating to about 9 % of its North American gross .

Context: In mathematics, a square matrix is a matrix where each row contains the same number of columns. A square matrix can be represented by an n x n rectangle, where n represents the number of rows and columns in the matrix. If you are dealing with a 2x2 or 3x3 square matrix, it is relatively straightforward to find the determinant and the inverse (if one exists). However, for larger square matrices, such as a 4x4 or 5x5, the process becomes much more complex. For instance, in a 4x4 matrix, you need to apply the Laplace expansion formula multiple times in order to calculate its determinant. In this sense, the larger the matrix size (i.e., n), the more difficult it is to compute the determinant and inverse.

Context: Ballard realized that looking for the wreck itself using sonar was unlikely to be successful and adopted a different tactic , drawing on the experience of the surveys of Thresher and Scorpion ; he would look for the debris field instead , using Argo 's cameras rather than sonar . Whereas sonar could not distinguish man - made debris on the sea bed from natural objects , cameras could . The debris field would also be a far bigger target , stretching a mile ( 1.6 km ) or longer , whereas Titanic itself was only 90 feet ( 27 m ) wide . The search required round - the - clock towing of Argo back and forth above the sea bed , with shifts of watchers aboard the research vessel Knorr looking at the camera pictures for any sign of debris . After a week of fruitless searching , at 12.48 am on Sunday 1 September 1985 pieces of debris began to appear on Knorr 's screens . One of them was identified as a boiler , identical to those shown in pictures from 1911 . The following day , the main part of the wreck was found and Argo sent back the first pictures of Titanic since her sinking 73 years before . The discovery made headlines around the world .

Context: France allied with the United States during the American Revolutionary War ( American War of Independence 1775 -- 1783 ) in 1778 , declared war on Great Britain , and sent its armies and navy to fight Britain while providing money and matériel to arm the new republic . French intervention made a decisive contribution to the U.S. victory in the war . Motivated by a long - term rivalry with Britain and by revenge for its territorial losses during the French and Indian War , France began secretly sending supplies in 1775 .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: Each canal is filled with a fluid called endolymph and contains motion sensors within the fluids . At the base of each canal , the bony region of the canal is enlarged which opens into the utricle and has a dilated sac at one end called the osseous ampullae . Within the ampulla is a mound of hair cells and supporting cells called crista ampullaris . These hair cells have many cytoplasmic projections on the apical surface called stereocilia which are embedded in a gelatinous structure called the cupula . As the head rotates the duct moves but the endolymph lags behind owing to inertia . This deflects the cupula and bends the stereocilia within . The bending of these stereocilia alters an electric signal that is transmitted to the brain . Within approximately 10 seconds of achieving constant motion , the endolymph catches up with the movement of the duct and the cupula is no longer affected , stopping the sensation of acceleration . The specific gravity of the cupula is comparable to that of the surrounding endolymph . Consequently , the cupula is not displaced by gravity , unlike the otolithic membranes of the utricle and saccule . As with macular hair cells , hair cells of the crista ampullaris will depolarise when the stereocilia deflect towards the kinocilium . Deflection in the opposite direction results in hyperpolarisation and inhibition . In the horizontal canal , ampullopetal flow is necessary for hair - cell stimulation , whereas ampullofugal flow is necessary in the anterior and posterior canals .

Context: With a worldwide box - office gross of over $2.7 billion , Avatar is often proclaimed to be the `` highest - grossing '' film , but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income , which can form a significant portion of a film 's earnings . Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful . Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals , in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters . While complete sales data are not available for Avatar , it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu - ray units in North America , and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu - ray units worldwide . After home video income is accounted for , both films have earned over $3 billion . Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film 's earnings , with a film often earning as much as 20 -- 25 % of its theatrical box - office for a couple of television runs on top of pay - per - view revenues ; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights , equating to about 9 % of its North American gross .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life . 
Question: where are genes located what are their functions.

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: The mining of minerals in Nigeria accounts for only 0.3 % of its GDP , due to the influence of its vast oil resources . The domestic mining industry is underdeveloped , leading to Nigeria having to import minerals that it could produce domestically , such as salt or iron ore . Rights to ownership of mineral resources is held by the Federal government of Nigeria , which grants titles to organizations to explore , mine , and sell mineral resources . Organized mining began in 1903 when the Mineral Survey of the Northern Protectorates was created by the British colonial government . A year later , the Mineral Survey of the Southern Protectorates was founded . By the 1940s , Nigeria was a major producer of tin , columbite , and coal . The discovery of oil in 1956 hurt the mineral extraction industries , as government and industry both began to focus on this new resource . The Nigerian Civil War in the late 1960s led many expatriate mining experts to leave the country . Mining regulation is handled by the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development , which oversees the management of all mineral resources . Mining law is codified in the Federal Minerals and Mining Act of 1999 . Historically , Nigeria 's mining industry was monopolized by state - owned public corporations . This led to a decline in productivity in almost all mineral industries . The Obasanjo administration began a process of selling off government - owned corporations to private investors in 1999 .

Context: In February 1933 , three men were arrested who were to play pivotal roles during the Leipzig Trial , known also as the `` Reichstag Fire Trial '' : Bulgarians Georgi Dimitrov , Vasil Tanev and Blagoy Popov .

Context: Diana 's bulletproof bracelets were formed from the remnants of Athena 's legendary shield , the Aegis , to be awarded to her champion . The shield was made from the indestructible hide of the great she - goat , Amalthea , who suckled Zeus as an infant . These forearm guards have thus far proven indestructible and able to absorb the impact of incoming attacks , allowing Wonder Woman to deflect automatic weapon fire and energy blasts . Diana can slam the bracelets together to create a wave of concussive force capable of making strong beings like Superman 's ears bleed . Recently , she gained the ability to channel Zeus 's lightning through her bracelets as well . Zeus explained to her that this power had been contained within the bracelets since their creation , because they were once part of the Aegis , and that he had only recently unlocked it for her use . After the 2011 relaunch of the character , it was revealed that Diana was the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta and that the bracelets are able to keep the powers she had inherited from Zeus in check . In addition , Hephaestus has modified the bracelets to allow Wonder Woman the sorcerous ability to manifest a sword of grayish metal from each bracelet . Each sword , marked with a red star , takes shape from a flash of lightning , and when Wonder Woman is done with them , the swords disappear , supposedly , back into her bracelets . As such , she has produced other weapons from the bracelets in this way such as a bow that fires explosive arrows , spears and energy bolts among others .

It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: A morpheme is the smallest grammatical unit in a language . In other words , it is the smallest meaningful unit of a language . The linguistics field of study dedicated to morphemes is called morphology . A morpheme is not identical to a word , and the principal difference between the two is that a morpheme may or may not stand alone , whereas a word , by definition , is freestanding . When a morpheme stands by itself , it is considered as a root because it has a meaning of its own ( e.g. the morpheme cat ) and when it depends on another morpheme to express an idea , it is an affix because it has a grammatical function ( e.g. the -- s in cats to indicate that it is plural ) . Every word comprises one or more morphemes .

Context: In 1643 , English scientist Robert Hooke discovered cells and named them after himself . In 1839 , a German physician named Matthias Schleiden observed that all plant tissues were composed of cells . The following year , Theodor Schwann , a German physiologist , made the same discovery for animal tissue . These discoveries led to the cell theory , which states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells . Cells are the smallest units of life and are responsible for carrying out all functions necessary for life . They can be classified into two main types : prokaryotic and eukaryotic . Prokaryotes are unicellular organisms without a true nucleus , while eukaryotes are multicellular organisms with a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: Unlike per capita GDP or standard of living , both of which can be measured in financial terms , it is harder to make objective or long - term measurements of the quality of life experienced by nations or other groups of people . Researchers have begun in recent times to distinguish two aspects of personal well - being : Emotional well - being , in which respondents are asked about the quality of their everyday emotional experiences -- the frequency and intensity of their experiences of , for example , joy , stress , sadness , anger , and affection -- and life evaluation , in which respondents are asked to think about their life in general and evaluate it against a scale . Such and other systems and scales of measurement have been in use for some time . Research has attempted to examine the relationship between quality of life and productivity . There are many different methods of measuring quality of life in terms of health care , wealth and materialistic goods . However , it is much more difficult to measure meaningful expression of one 's desires . One way to do so is to evaluate the scope of how individuals have fulfilled their own ideals .

Context: Historically , the constellations can be simply divided into two regions ; namely the northern and southern sky , whose origins are distinctly different . The northern skies have constellations that have mostly survived since Antiquity , whose common names are based on Classical Greek legends or those whose true origins have now been lost . Evidence of these constellations have survived in the form of star charts , whose oldest representation appears on the statue known as the Farnese Atlas , which has been suggested to be based on the star catalogue of the Greek astronomer , Hipparchus . Southern hemisphere constellations are more modern inventions , which were created as new constellations , or become substitutes for some ancient constellation . e.g. Argo Navis . Some southern constellations were to become obsolete or had extended names that became foreshortened to more usable forms e.g. Musca Australis became simply Musca .

In 1911, a federal court ruled that Standard Oil had to be dissolved because it constituted an illegal monopoly under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The company then split into 34 separate companies, including Exxon and Mobil.
Question: who was john d rockefeller and what did he do with his oil refinery business.
Response:John D. Rockefeller was an American business magnate who founded the Standard Oil trust in 1870. By 1892, Standard Oil controlled 90% of the oil refining industry in the United States. In 1911, a federal court ruled that Standard Oil had to be dissolved because it constituted an illegal monopoly under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The company then split into 34 separate companies, including Exxon and Mobil.

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: Players who are not drafted in a league 's annual draft of amateur players are considered to be unrestricted free agents and are free to sign contracts with any team . In most North American professional sports , players are drafted by sequencing each team from worst to best ( according to the teams ' immediately preceding season record , sometimes invoking a draft lottery factor to avoid having teams intentionally lose their last games to gain higher draft position ) and allowing said teams to claim rights to the top players entering the league that year . Players that pass through an entire draft ( usually several rounds ) without being selected by any of the league 's teams become unrestricted free agents , and these players are sometimes identified simply as an undrafted free agent ( UDFA ) or undrafted sportsperson and are free to sign with any team they choose . The term `` undrafted free agent '' is most common in the National Football League , where rookies enter directly into the NFL and do not play in a minor league system . It can also occasionally be seen in the National Hockey League , which increasingly uses college hockey as a source ; the NHL Entry Draft usually drafts players during high school age ( i.e. , junior leagues ) , which allows overlooked players who excel at the college level or in European professional leagues to bypass the draft and sign directly with the NHL .

Context: With a worldwide box - office gross of over $2.7 billion , Avatar is often proclaimed to be the `` highest - grossing '' film , but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income , which can form a significant portion of a film 's earnings . Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful . Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals , in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters . While complete sales data are not available for Avatar , it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu - ray units in North America , and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu - ray units worldwide . After home video income is accounted for , both films have earned over $3 billion . Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film 's earnings , with a film often earning as much as 20 -- 25 % of its theatrical box - office for a couple of television runs on top of pay - per - view revenues ; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights , equating to about 9 % of its North American gross .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: In `` New Guys '' , Andy returns from Outward Bound manager training , making him become more `` decisive and confident '' . When Andy tells Toby that he plans to fabricate an excuse to fire Nellie , Toby shoots down the idea as a violation of corporate policy , prompting Andy to tell Toby `` I understand why Michael did n't like you . '' When Andy hosts a motivational exercise involving a tightrope , he insults Toby and Nellie in front of the staff . Since that time , Andy has been rude towards Toby in a manner that echoes Michael Scott 's hatred of his harmless HR rep , though Toby seems much less affected by Andy 's behavior than he was by Michael 's . When Andy went off on his long boat trip , Toby 's time in the last season was devoted to his unrequited romantic interest in Nellie Bertram and his belief that he 'd convicted an innocent man during his jury time on the Scranton Strangler case ( a theory he put to rest when he went to visit the convict in prison and was , in fact , strangled and nearly killed by him ) . In the series finale , it 's revealed that Toby was fired immediately after Dwight fired Kevin Malone ( it 's likely that the Corporate office fired Toby and Dwight simply had the burden of telling him ) and Toby then moved to New York where he 's trying to become a novelist and has six roommates . Toby surprises his former co-workers at the reunion panel when he says that his life feels meaningless now that he 's not being filmed for the documentary anymore . He breaks down in tears while dancing with Pam at Dwight and Angela 's wedding , saying of what 's bad in his life that `` It 's everything !

Context: The most common form of cancer is skin cancer, with basal cell carcinoma being the most prevalent type. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, approximately 80% of Americans will develop at least one basal cell carcinoma by the age of 70. Basal cell carcinomas typically appear as small, scaly bumps or nodules on the skin, often with pearly edges and a central depression. They may also present as flat, pinkish patches that are slightly raised. Although rare, some basal cell carcinomas can grow larger and deeper into the skin, leading to potential disfigurement and increased risk of metastasis. Early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing these complications.

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life . 
Question: where are genes located what are their functions.

Context: The role of the Emperor of Japan has historically alternated between a largely ceremonial symbolic role and that of an actual imperial ruler . Since the establishment of the first shogunate in 1199 , the Emperors of Japan have rarely taken on a role as supreme battlefield commander , unlike many Western monarchs .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions .

Context: The eighth named storm , third hurricane , and the first major hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season , Harvey developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles , reaching tropical storm status on August 17 . The storm crossed through the Windward Islands on the following day , passing just south of Barbados and later near Saint Vincent . Upon entering the Caribbean Sea , Harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear and degenerated into a tropical wave north of Colombia early on August 20 . The remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west - northwestward across the Caribbean and the Yucatán Peninsula , before redeveloping over the Bay of Campeche on August 23 . Harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August 24 , regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day . While the storm moved generally northwest , Harvey 's intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from August 24 -- 25 ; however , Harvey soon resumed strengthening and quickly became a major hurricane and attained Category 4 intensity later that day . Hours later , Harvey made landfall near Rockport , Texas , at peak intensity . Afterwards , rapid weakening ensued , and Harvey had downgraded to a tropical storm as it stalled near the coastline of the state , dropping torrential and unprecedented amounts of rainfall over the Lone Star state . On August 28 , it emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico , strengthening slightly before making a third and final landfall in Louisiana on August 29 . As Harvey drifted inland , it quickly weakened again as it became extratropical on September 1 , before dissipating two days later .

Context: Unlike most Western countries , 18 of the U.S. states do not have a legal minimum age of marriage . Individuals aged 18 have the ability to marry in U.S. states except Nebraska ( 19 ) and Mississippi ( 21 ) . In addition , all states , except Delaware and New Jersey , allow minors to marry in certain circumstances , such as parental consent , judicial consent , pregnancy , or a combination of these situations . Most states allow parties aged 16 and 17 to marry with parental consent alone . In most states , children under 16 can be married too . In the 32 states which have an absolute minimum age set by statute , this age varies between 14 and 18 , while in 18 states there is no statutory minimum age if other legal conditions are met . Although in such states there is no set minimum age by statute , the traditional common law minimum age is 14 for boys and 12 for girls - ages which have been confirmed by case law in some states . Over the past 15 years , more than 200,000 minors married in US , and in Tennessee girls as young as 10 were married in 2001 , before the state finally set a minimum age of 17 in 2018 .

Context: In his seminal work `` The Structure of Scientific Revolutions '' ( 1962 ) , Kuhn discussed the dynamics of revolutionary changes in scientific knowledge . He proposed a paradigm is a scientific achievement that provides models for others to emulate and a set of rules and standards for evaluation . A discipline 's paradigms are the foundation on which all other knowledge rests . When new observations are not compatible with a given paradigm, scientists may adopt a new one , often through a process called `` paradigm shift '' . A paradigm shift occurs when a scientific community abandons its old models and theories for new ones , leading to revolutionary changes in the field . Paradigm shifts typically occur only when a consensus has been reached among experts in the field that the existing paradigm has failed to provide an accurate explanation of certain phenomena , or when there is overwhelming evidence against it .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

In return, the United States agreed to help suppress piracy in the Yangtze River delta . However, the treaty did not contain a provision for most-favored-nation status , so when Britain signed a more favorable treaty with China in 1843 ( the Treaty of Nanking ), the United States was unable to secure similar terms from China .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: The cell cycle or cell - division cycle is the series of events that take place in a cell leading to its division and duplication of its DNA ( DNA replication ) to produce two daughter cells . In bacteria , which lack a cell nucleus , the cell cycle is divided into the B , C , and D periods . The B period extends from the end of cell division to the beginning of DNA replication . DNA replication occurs during the C period . The D period refers to the stage between the end of DNA replication and the splitting of the bacterial cell into two daughter cells . In cells with a nucleus , as in eukaryotes , the cell cycle is also divided into three periods : interphase , the mitotic ( M ) phase , and cytokinesis . During interphase , the cell grows , accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis , preparing it for a big cell division and duplicating its DNA . During the mitotic phase , the chromosomes separate . During the final stage , cytokinesis , the chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells . To ensure the proper division of the cell , there are control mechanisms known as cell cycle checkpoints. This helps the cell produce even more

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: Social exchange theory goes back to Thibaut and Kelley ( 1959 ) , Kelley and Thibaut ( 1978 ) , Homans ( 1961 ) and Rusbult ( 1983 ) . Sociologist George Homans published a work `` Social Behavior as Exchange '' . He defined social exchange as the exchange of activity , tangible or intangible , and more or less rewarding or costly , between at least two persons . After Homans founded the theory , other theorists continued to write about it , particularly Peter M. Blau and Richard M. Emerson , who in addition to Homans are generally thought of as the major developers of the exchange perspective within sociology . Homans ' work emphasized the individual behavior of actors in interaction with one another . Although there are various modes of exchange , Homans centered his studies on dyadic exchange . John Thibaut and Harold Kelley are recognized for focusing their studies within the theory on the psychological concepts , the dyad and small group . Lévi - Strauss is recognized for contributing to the emergence of this theoretical perspective from his work on anthropology focused on systems of generalized exchange , such as kinship systems and gift exchange .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: The Delaware River rises in two main branches that descend from the western flank of the Catskill Mountains in New York . The West Branch begins near Mount Jefferson in the Town of Jefferson in Schoharie County . The river 's East Branch begins at Grand Gorge near Roxbury in Delaware County . These two branches flow west and merge near Hancock in Delaware County , and the combined waters flow as the Delaware River south . Through its course , the Delaware River forms the boundaries between Pennsylvania and New York , the entire boundary between New Jersey and Pennsylvania , and most of the boundary between Delaware and New Jersey . The river meets tide - water at the junction of Morrisville , Pennsylvania , and Trenton , New Jersey , at the Falls of the Delaware . The river 's navigable , tidal section served as a conduit for shipping and transportation that aided the development of the industrial cities of Trenton , Camden , and Philadelphia .

Context: The first transcontinental railroad (also called the Great Transcontinental Railroad, known originally as the ""Pacific Railroad"" and later as the ""Overland Route"") was a 1,912-mile (3,077 km) continuous railroad line constructed between 1863 and 1869 that connected the existing eastern U.S. rail network at Omaha, Nebraska/Council Bluffs, Iowa with the Pacific coast at the Oakland Long Wharf on San Francisco Bay. The rail line was built by three private companies over public lands provided by extensive US land grants. Construction was financed by both state and US government subsidy bonds as well as by company issued mortgage bonds. The Western Pacific Railroad Company built 132 mi (212 km) of track from Oakland/Alameda to Sacramento, California. The Central Pacific Railroad Company of California (CPRR) constructed 690 mi (1,110 km) eastward from Sacramento to Promontory Summit, Utah Territory (U.T.). The Union Pacific built 1,085 mi (1,746 km) from the road's eastern terminus at Council Bluffs near Omaha, Nebraska westward to Promontory Summit.
