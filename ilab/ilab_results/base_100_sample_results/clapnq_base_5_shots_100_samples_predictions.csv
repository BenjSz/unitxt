Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: The ground tissue of plants includes all tissues that are neither dermal nor vascular . It can be divided into three classes based on the nature of the cell walls . Parenchyma cells have thin primary walls and usually remain alive after they become mature . Parenchyma forms the `` filler '' tissue in the soft parts of plants. usually present in cortex , pericycle , pith , and medullary rays in primary stem and root . Collenchyma cells have thin primary walls with some areas of secondary thickening . Collenchyma provides extra structural support , particularly in regions of new growth . Sclerenchyma cells have thick lignified secondary walls and often die when mature . Sclerenchyma provides the main structural support to a plant .

Context: Seasonality is a characteristic of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes which recur every calendar year . Any predictable change or pattern in a time series that recurs or repeats over a one - year period can be said to be seasonal . It is common in many situations -- such as grocery store or even in a Medical Examiner 's office -- that the demand depends on the day of the week . In such situations , the forecasting procedure calculates the seasonal index of the `` season '' -- seven seasons , one for each day -- which is the ratio of the average demand of that season ( which is calculated by Moving Average or Exponential Smoothing using historical data corresponding only to that season ) to the average demand across all seasons . An index higher than 1 indicates that demand is higher than average ; an index less than 1 indicates that the demand is less than the average . 
Question: which method of forecasting uses averages to predict future weather.
Response:","['Seasonality, in which data experiences regular and predictable changes which recur every calendar year, is the method of forecasting, where averages are used to calculate the seasonal index of the season.']","The forecasting procedure calculates the seasonal index of the `` season '' -- seven seasons , one for each day -- which is the ratio of the average demand of that season ( which is calculated by Moving Average or Exponential Smoothing using historical data corresponding only to that season ) to the average demand across all seasons .

Context: With a worldwide box - office gross of over $2.7 billion , Avatar is often proclaimed to be the `` highest - grossing '' film , but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income , which can form a significant portion of a film 's earnings . Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful . Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals , in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters . While complete sales data are not available for Avatar , it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu - ray units in North America , and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu - ray units worldwide . After home video income is accounted for , both films have earned over $3 billion . Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film 's earnings , with a film often earning as much as 20 -- 25 % of its theatrical box - office for a couple of television runs on top of pay - per - view revenues ; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights , equating to about 9 % of its North American gross .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: Because the prime minister is , in practice , the most politically powerful member of the Canadian government , he or she is sometimes erroneously referred to as Canada 's head of state , when , in fact , that post is held by the Canadian monarch , represented by the governor general . The prime minister is , instead , the head of government and is responsible for advising the Crown on how to exercise the Royal Prerogative and its executive powers , which are governed by the constitution and its conventions . However , the function of the prime minister has evolved with increasing power . Today , as per the doctrines of constitutional monarchy , the advice given by the prime minister is ordinarily binding , meaning the prime minister effectively carries out those duties ascribed to the sovereign or governor general , leaving the latter to act in predominantly ceremonial fashions . As such , the prime minister , supported by the Office of the Prime Minister ( PMO ) , controls the appointments of many key figures in Canada 's system of governance , including the governor general , the Cabinet , justices of the Supreme Court , senators , heads of crown corporations , ambassadors to foreign countries , the provincial lieutenant governors , and approximately 3,100 other positions .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: Insulin ( from Latin insula , island ) is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreatic islets ; it is considered to be the main anabolic hormone of the body . It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates , fats and protein by promoting the absorption of , especially glucose from the blood into liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells . In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen via glycogenesis or fats ( triglycerides ) via lipogenesis , or , in the case of the liver , into both . Glucose production and secretion by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood . Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues . It is therefore an anabolic hormone , promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules inside the cells . Low insulin levels in the blood have the opposite effect by promoting widespread catabolism , especially of reserve body fat . 
Question: what is the function of insulin and where is it produced.

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: Frank was a prolific author , writing 40 books . He published widely on political economy , economic history , international relations , historical sociology , and world history . Perhaps his most notable work is Capitalism and Underdevelopment in Latin America . Published in 1967 , it was one of the formative texts in dependency theory . In his later career he produced works such as ReOrient : Global Economy in the Asian Age and , with Barry Gills , The World System : Five Hundred Years or Five Thousand . Frank 's theories center on the idea that a nation 's economic strength , largely determined by historical circumstances -- especially geography -- dictates its global power . He is also well known for suggesting that purely export oriented solutions to development create imbalances detrimental to poor countries . Frank has made significant contributions to the world - systems theory ( which , according to him , should be rather called the World System one ) . He has argued that a World System was formed no later than in the 4th millennium BC ; his argument contrasts sharply with the scholarly majority who posit beginnings in the `` long 16th century '' ( a position held , for example , by Immanuel Wallerstein ) . Frank also insisted that the idea of numerous `` world - systems '' did not make much sense ( indeed , if there are many `` world - systems '' in the world , then they simply do not deserve to be called `` world - systems '' ) , and we should rather speak about one single World System .

Context: The study of cellular respiration focuses on how cells break down glucose to produce ATP . This process can be divided into three main stages : glycolysis , which occurs in the cytosol ; the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle) , which takes place in the mitochondria ; and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), which is also located in the mitochondria. The first stage of cellular respiration, glycolysis, occurs in the cytosol and breaks down one molecule of glucose into two pyruvate molecules, yielding a net gain of 2 ATP molecules , 2 NADH molecules , and 2 water molecules. The second stage, the citric acid cycle, takes place in the mitochondria and yields an additional 1 ATP molecule , 3 NADH molecules , and 1 FADH2 molecule for each glucose molecule consumed. Finally, the third stage of cellular respiration, OxPhos, involves oxidizing pyruvate and NADH from the citric acid cycle, producing up to 30 ATP molecules per glucose molecule in a process called chemiosmosis. The total ATP yield for one molecule of glucose is therefore approximately 38 ATP molecules.
Question: how many atp molecules are produced from the citric acid cycle?
Response:The second stage, the citric acid cycle, takes place in the mitochondria and yields an additional 1 ATP molecule , 3 NADH molecules , and 1 FADH2 molecule for each glucose molecule consumed.

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions .

Context: In the 2007 book , ""The Tipping Point,"" Malcolm Gladwell argues that the reason why the rate of teenage pregnancy is higher in some American cities than others cannot be explained by factors such as race, education level, or income alone. He attributes this discrepancy to social phenomena known as ""tipping points."" A tipping point is a critical point in an evolving situation that leads to a chain reaction resulting in significant change . In the context of teenage pregnancy , Gladwell suggests that when the rate of teenage pregnancy reaches a certain threshold (the ""tipping point""), it can create a self - reinforcing cycle in which more and more girls become pregnant. Once this tipping point is reached, even if conditions change to reduce the overall rate of teenage pregnancies , the high rate will persist due to the large number of already pregnant girls .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life . 
Question: where are genes located what are their functions.

Context: The ground tissue of plants includes all tissues that are neither dermal nor vascular . It can be divided into three classes based on the nature of the cell walls . Parenchyma cells have thin primary walls and usually remain alive after they become mature . Parenchyma forms the `` filler '' tissue in the soft parts of plants. usually present in cortex , pericycle , pith , and medullary rays in primary stem and root . Collenchyma cells have thin primary walls with some areas of secondary thickening . Collenchyma provides extra structural support , particularly in regions of new growth . Sclerenchyma cells have thick lignified secondary walls and often die when mature . Sclerenchyma provides the main structural support to a plant .

Context: A likely and documented explanation is that the term is derived from the `` dead horse '' ritual of seamen ( see Beating a dead horse ) . In this practice , the seaman paraded a straw - stuffed effigy of a horse around the deck before throwing it overboard . Seamen were paid partly in advance before a long voyage , and they frequently spent their pay all at once , resulting in a period of time without income . If they got advances from the ship 's paymaster , they would incur debt . This period was called the `` dead horse '' time , and it usually lasted a month or two . The seaman 's ceremony was to celebrate having worked off the `` dead horse '' debt . As west - bound shipping from Europe usually reached the subtropics at about the time the `` dead horse '' was worked off , the latitude became associated with the ceremony . 
Question: how did the horse latitudes get their name.

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: The main purpose of a myelin sheath is to increase the speed at which impulses propagate along the myelinated fiber . Along unmyelinated fibers , impulses continuously move as waves , but , in myelinated fibers , they `` hop '' or propagate by saltatory conduction . Myelin decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance across the cell membrane ( the axolemma ) . Thus , myelination prevents the electric current from leaving the axon . It has been suggested that myelin permits larger body size by maintaining agile communication between distant body parts .

Context: In mathematics, an exponential function is a mathematical function of the form , where e is approximately equal to 2.71828. The exponential function can be defined in terms of its own value at any given point as , and also as the limit of sequences involving integer powers . It can also be used to define other functions such as trigonometric, logarithmic, and hyperbolic functions . Its graph rises from zero and does not intersect the x axis, because it is increasing but never reaches an upper bound . The exponential function approaches the line y = x as x increases without bound. This is due to its asymptotic behavior , which means that for any given positive value of x , there is a corresponding positive value of e such that the difference between the two values is arbitrarily small .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: With a worldwide box - office gross of over $2.7 billion , Avatar is often proclaimed to be the `` highest - grossing '' film , but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income , which can form a significant portion of a film 's earnings . Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful . Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals , in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters . While complete sales data are not available for Avatar , it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu - ray units in North America , and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu - ray units worldwide . After home video income is accounted for , both films have earned over $3 billion . Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film 's earnings , with a film often earning as much as 20 -- 25 % of its theatrical box - office for a couple of television runs on top of pay - per - view revenues ; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights , equating to about 9 % of its North American gross .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life . 
Question: where are genes located what are their functions.

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: A major cause of death among people who are homeless in the US is hypothermia. Homeless persons are also at greater risk for suicide than the rest of the general population. In addition to being more susceptible to serious illnesses, such as tuberculosis and pneumonia, the life expectancy for a person living on the streets is approximately 50% lower than that of a housed individual. The causes are primarily related to malnutrition, poor health care, drug and alcohol abuse, mental illness, and violence. This paper will examine the issue of homelessness in the United States through a public policy lens, focusing on the governmental response to this problem at both the federal and state levels.

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: The origin of the person of Jonas Bronck ( c. 1600 -- 43 ) is contested . Some sources claim he was a Swedish born emigrant from Komstad , Norra Ljunga parish in Småland , Sweden , who arrived in New Netherland during the spring of 1639 . Bronck became the first recorded European settler in the area now known as the Bronx and built a farm named `` Emmanus '' close to what today is the corner of Willis Avenue and 132nd Street in Mott Haven . He leased land from the Dutch West India Company on the neck of the mainland immediately north of the Dutch settlement in Harlem ( on Manhattan Island ) , and bought additional tracts from the local tribes . He eventually accumulated 500 acres ( 200 ha ) between the Harlem River and the Aquahung , which became known as Bronck 's River or the Bronx ( River ) . Dutch and English settlers referred to the area as Bronck 's Land . The American poet William Bronk was a descendant of Pieter Bronck , either Jonas Bronck 's son or his younger brother .

Context: The cell membrane ( also known as the plasma membrane or cytoplasmic membrane , and historically referred to as the plasmalemma ) is a biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment ( the extracellular space ) . It consists of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins . The basic function of the cell membrane is to protect the cell from its surroundings . The cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of cells and organelles . In this way , it is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules . In addition , cell membranes are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell adhesion , ion conductivity and cell signalling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures , including the cell wall , the carbohydrate layer called the glycocalyx , and the intracellular network of protein fibers called the cytoskeleton . In the field of synthetic biology , cell membranes can be artificially reassembled .

Context: With a worldwide box - office gross of over $2.7 billion , Avatar is often proclaimed to be the `` highest - grossing '' film , but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income , which can form a significant portion of a film 's earnings . Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful . Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals , in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters . While complete sales data are not available for Avatar , it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu - ray units in North America , and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu - ray units worldwide . After home video income is accounted for , both films have earned over $3 billion . Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film 's earnings , with a film often earning as much as 20 -- 25 % of its theatrical box - office for a couple of television runs on top of pay - per - view revenues ; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights , equating to about 9 % of its North American gross .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: The world 's first movable type printing press technology for printing paper books was made of porcelain materials and was invented around AD 1040 in China during the Northern Song Dynasty by the inventor Bi Sheng ( 990 -- 1051 ) . Subsequently in 1377 , the world 's oldest extant movable metal print book , Jikji , was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty . Because of this , the diffusion of both movable - type systems was , to some degree , limited to primarily East Asia , although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries , traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe . Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others . Around 1450 Johannes Gutenberg , introduced the metal movable - type printing press in Europe , along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould . The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor . Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead , tin , and antimony -- and these materials remained standard for 550 years .

Context: The 20th century was a period of great change for American women . During this time , women gained more rights and liberties in various aspects of life , including access to education , employment , voting , property ownership and divorce . However , despite these advancements , many issues persisted and remain unresolved today . For example , the gender pay gap has been a longstanding issue , where women earn less than men for the same work . Another persistent issue is that women are often underrepresented in leadership positions in politics and business . Additionally , domestic violence continues to be a significant problem . The #MeToo movement highlighted the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault in American society , particularly in the workplace . Despite these challenges , there have also been many successes for women 's rights throughout the 20th century . Women gained the right to vote with the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920 . The Equal Pay Act was passed in 1963 , which prohibits sex - based wage discrimination between men and women performing substantially equal work . Title IX , enacted in 1972 , banned gender discrimination in education and has led to increased opportunities for girls and women in sports .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: In economics , tax incidence or tax burden is the analysis of the effect of a particular tax on the distribution of economic welfare . The introduction of a tax drives a wedge between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive for a product , which typically imposes an economic burden on both producers and consumers . The concept was brought to attention by the French Physiocrats , in particular François Quesnay , who argued that the incidence of all taxation falls ultimately on landowners and is at the expense of land rent . Tax incidence is said to `` fall '' upon the group that ultimately bears the burden of , or ultimately has to pay , the tax . The key concept is that the tax incidence or tax burden does not depend on where the revenue is collected , but on the price elasticity of demand and price elasticity of supply .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: The term ""cold fusion"" is a misnomer , because it implies that nuclear fusion occurs at relatively low temperatures ( cold ) rather than under extreme temperatures and pressures ( hot ). Nonetheless , the term has stuck in popular usage . In the early 1980s , electrochemists Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons claimed to have produced a self-sustaining, room-temperature nuclear fusion reaction . Their announcement was met with widespread skepticism by many scientists . While there were indications of unusual heat generation during their experiments , the results could not be independently confirmed . Fleishmann and Pons ' research was subsequently discredited , as no one has been able to replicate their experiment to this day , even though some researchers have spent years trying .

It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: The Berlin Wall ( German : Berliner Mauer , pronounced ( bɛʁˈliːnɐ ˈmaʊ̯ɐ ) ( listen ) ) was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989 . Constructed by the German Democratic Republic ( GDR , East Germany ) , starting on 13 August 1961 , the Wall cut off ( by land ) West Berlin from virtually all of surrounding East Germany and East Berlin until government officials opened it in November 1989 . Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and finished in 1992 . The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls , accompanied by a wide area ( later known as the `` death strip '' ) that contained anti-vehicle trenches , `` fakir beds '' and other defenses . The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the `` will of the people '' in building a socialist state in East Germany .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: With a worldwide box - office gross of over $2.7 billion , Avatar is often proclaimed to be the `` highest - grossing '' film , but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income , which can form a significant portion of a film 's earnings . Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful . Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals , in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters . While complete sales data are not available for Avatar , it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu - ray units in North America , and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu - ray units worldwide . After home video income is accounted for , both films have earned over $3 billion . Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film 's earnings , with a film often earning as much as 20 -- 25 % of its theatrical box - office for a couple of television runs on top of pay - per - view revenues ; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights , equating to about 9 % of its North American gross .

Context: Ballard realized that looking for the wreck itself using sonar was unlikely to be successful and adopted a different tactic , drawing on the experience of the surveys of Thresher and Scorpion ; he would look for the debris field instead , using Argo 's cameras rather than sonar . Whereas sonar could not distinguish man - made debris on the sea bed from natural objects , cameras could . The debris field would also be a far bigger target , stretching a mile ( 1.6 km ) or longer , whereas Titanic itself was only 90 feet ( 27 m ) wide . The search required round - the - clock towing of Argo back and forth above the sea bed , with shifts of watchers aboard the research vessel Knorr looking at the camera pictures for any sign of debris . After a week of fruitless searching , at 12.48 am on Sunday 1 September 1985 pieces of debris began to appear on Knorr 's screens . One of them was identified as a boiler , identical to those shown in pictures from 1911 . The following day , the main part of the wreck was found and Argo sent back the first pictures of Titanic since her sinking 73 years before . The discovery made headlines around the world .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: France allied with the United States during the American Revolutionary War ( American War of Independence 1775 -- 1783 ) in 1778 , declared war on Great Britain , and sent its armies and navy to fight Britain while providing money and matériel to arm the new republic . French intervention made a decisive contribution to the U.S. victory in the war . Motivated by a long - term rivalry with Britain and by revenge for its territorial losses during the French and Indian War , France began secretly sending supplies in 1775 . Spain and the Netherlands joined France , making it a global war in which the British had no major allies . France incurred a debt of over 1 billion livres .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection . 
Question: what hymn did they play on the titanic.

Context: With a worldwide box - office gross of over $2.7 billion , Avatar is often proclaimed to be the `` highest - grossing '' film , but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income , which can form a significant portion of a film 's earnings . Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful . Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals , in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters . While complete sales data are not available for Avatar , it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu - ray units in North America , and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu - ray units worldwide . After home video income is accounted for , both films have earned over $3 billion . Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film 's earnings , with a film often earning as much as 20 -- 25 % of its theatrical box - office for a couple of television runs on top of pay - per - view revenues ; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights , equating to about 9 % of its North American gross .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: Each canal is filled with a fluid called endolymph and contains motion sensors within the fluids . At the base of each canal , the bony region of the canal is enlarged which opens into the utricle and has a dilated sac at one end called the osseous ampullae . Within the ampulla is a mound of hair cells and supporting cells called crista ampullaris . These hair cells have many cytoplasmic projections on the apical surface called stereocilia which are embedded in a gelatinous structure called the cupula . As the head rotates the duct moves but the endolymph lags behind owing to inertia . This deflects the cupula and bends the stereocilia within . The bending of these stereocilia alters an electric signal that is transmitted to the brain . Within approximately 10 seconds of achieving constant motion , the endolymph catches up with the movement of the duct and the cupula is no longer affected , stopping the sensation of acceleration . The specific gravity of the cupula is comparable to that of the surrounding endolymph . Consequently , the cupula is not displaced by gravity , unlike the otolithic membranes of the utricle and saccule . As with macular hair cells , hair cells of the crista ampullaris will depolarise when the stereocilia deflect towards the kinocilium . Deflection in the opposite direction results in hyperpolarisation and inhibition . In the horizontal canal , ampullopetal flow is necessary for hair - cell stimulation , whereas ampullofugal flow is necessary in the anterior and posterior canals .

Context: A new study from the University of Colorado has found that a key protein involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease may also help to explain why people with diabetes have an increased risk for developing the disease . The research found that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) , a hormone produced by the liver and pancreas , plays a crucial role in both the development of Alzheimer's and diabetes . IGF-1 helps to regulate blood sugar levels and also promotes the growth and repair of cells in the brain . However, when levels of IGF-1 are too high or low , it can lead to cell damage and death . In people with diabetes , high levels of glucose can damage blood vessels and nerves , leading to a decrease in IGF-1 production . This decrease in IGF-1 can then lead to a decline in brain function and an increased risk for Alzheimer's . The study suggests that maintaining healthy levels of IGF-1 may be important for reducing the risk of both diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: With a worldwide box - office gross of over $2.7 billion , Avatar is often proclaimed to be the `` highest - grossing '' film , but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income , which can form a significant portion of a film 's earnings . Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful . Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals , in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters . While complete sales data are not available for Avatar , it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu - ray units in North America , and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu - ray units worldwide . After home video income is accounted for , both films have earned over $3 billion . Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film 's earnings , with a film often earning as much as 20 -- 25 % of its theatrical box - office for a couple of television runs on top of pay - per - view revenues ; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights , equating to about 9 % of its North American gross .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection . 
Question: what hymn did they play on the titanic.
Response:A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band .

Context: The mining of minerals in Nigeria accounts for only 0.3 % of its GDP , due to the influence of its vast oil resources . The domestic mining industry is underdeveloped , leading to Nigeria having to import minerals that it could produce domestically , such as salt or iron ore . Rights to ownership of mineral resources is held by the Federal government of Nigeria , which grants titles to organizations to explore , mine , and sell mineral resources . Organized mining began in 1903 when the Mineral Survey of the Northern Protectorates was created by the British colonial government . A year later , the Mineral Survey of the Southern Protectorates was founded . By the 1940s , Nigeria was a major producer of tin , columbite , and coal . The discovery of oil in 1956 hurt the mineral extraction industries , as government and industry both began to focus on this new resource . The Nigerian Civil War in the late 1960s led many expatriate mining experts to leave the country . Mining regulation is handled by the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development , which oversees the management of all mineral resources . Mining law is codified in the Federal Minerals and Mining Act of 1999 . Historically , Nigeria 's mining industry was monopolized by state - owned public corporations . This led to a decline in productivity in almost all mineral industries . The Obasanjo administration began a process of selling off government - owned corporations to private investors in 1999 .

Context: Diana 's bulletproof bracelets were formed from the remnants of Athena 's legendary shield , the Aegis , to be awarded to her champion . The shield was made from the indestructible hide of the great she - goat , Amalthea , who suckled Zeus as an infant . These forearm guards have thus far proven indestructible and able to absorb the impact of incoming attacks , allowing Wonder Woman to deflect automatic weapon fire and energy blasts . Diana can slam the bracelets together to create a wave of concussive force capable of making strong beings like Superman 's ears bleed . Recently , she gained the ability to channel Zeus 's lightning through her bracelets as well . Zeus explained to her that this power had been contained within the bracelets since their creation , because they were once part of the Aegis , and that he had only recently unlocked it for her use . After the 2011 relaunch of the character , it was revealed that Diana was the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta and that the bracelets are able to keep the powers she had inherited from Zeus in check . In addition , Hephaestus has modified the bracelets to allow Wonder Woman the sorcerous ability to manifest a sword of grayish metal from each bracelet . Each sword , marked with a red star , takes shape from a flash of lightning , and when Wonder Woman is done with them , the swords disappear , supposedly , back into her bracelets . As such , she has produced other weapons from the bracelets in this way such as a bow that fires explosive arrows , spears and energy bolts among others .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: A morpheme is the smallest grammatical unit in a language . In other words , it is the smallest meaningful unit of a language . The linguistics field of study dedicated to morphemes is called morphology . A morpheme is not identical to a word , and the principal difference between the two is that a morpheme may or may not stand alone , whereas a word , by definition , is freestanding . When a morpheme stands by itself , it is considered as a root because it has a meaning of its own ( e.g. the morpheme cat ) and when it depends on another morpheme to express an idea , it is an affix because it has a grammatical function ( e.g. the -- s in cats to indicate that it is plural ) . Every word comprises one or more morphemes .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Researchers have begun in recent times to distinguish two aspects of personal well - being : Emotional well - being , in which respondents are asked about the quality of their everyday emotional experiences -- the frequency and intensity of their experiences of , for example , joy , stress , sadness , anger , and affection -- and life evaluation , in which respondents are asked to think about their life in general and evaluate it against a scale . Such and other systems and scales of measurement have been in use for some time . Research has attempted to examine the relationship between quality of life and productivity . There are many different methods of measuring quality of life in terms of health care , wealth and materialistic goods . However , it is much more difficult to measure meaningful expression of one 's desires . One way to do so is to evaluate the scope of how individuals have fulfilled their own ideals . Quality of life can simply mean happiness , the subjective state of mind . By using that mentality , citizens of a developing country appreciate more since they are content with the basic necessities of health care , education and child protection .

Context: Historically , the constellations can be simply divided into two regions ; namely the northern and southern sky , whose origins are distinctly different . The northern skies have constellations that have mostly survived since Antiquity , whose common names are based on Classical Greek legends or those whose true origins have now been lost . Evidence of these constellations have survived in the form of star charts , whose oldest representation appears on the statue known as the Farnese Atlas , which has been suggested to be based on the star catalogue of the Greek astronomer , Hipparchus . Southern hemisphere constellations are more modern inventions , which were created as new constellations , or become substitutes for some ancient constellation . e.g. Argo Navis . Some southern constellations were to become obsolete or had extended names that became foreshortened to more usable forms e.g. Musca Australis became simply Musca .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: Players who are not drafted in a league 's annual draft of amateur players are considered to be unrestricted free agents and are free to sign contracts with any team . In most North American professional sports , players are drafted by sequencing each team from worst to best ( according to the teams ' immediately preceding season record , sometimes invoking a draft lottery factor to avoid having teams intentionally lose their last games to gain higher draft position ) and allowing said teams to claim rights to the top players entering the league that year . Players that pass through an entire draft ( usually several rounds ) without being selected by any of the league 's teams become unrestricted free agents , and these players are sometimes identified simply as an undrafted free agent ( UDFA ) or undrafted sportsperson and are free to sign with any team they choose . The term `` undrafted free agent '' is most common in the National Football League , where rookies enter directly into the NFL and do not play in a minor league system . It can also occasionally be seen in the National Hockey League , which increasingly uses college hockey as a source ; the NHL Entry Draft usually drafts players during high school age ( i.e. , junior leagues ) , which allows overlooked players who excel at the college level or in European professional leagues to bypass the draft and sign directly with the NHL .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Although Lyme disease was first discovered in Lyme , Connecticut , in 1975 , it is not confined to the northeastern United States and has been identified in every state but Rhode Island . The geographic distribution of the disease varies from year to year as a result of environmental conditions such as temperature and rainfall that influence the survival and reproduction of ticks and the bacteria they transmit .
Question: what is lyme disease caused by?
Response:The disease is transmitted to humans through infected black - legged ticks ( Ixodes scapularis ) also known as deer ticks and western black - legged ticks ( Ixodes pacificus ) .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: The eighth named storm , third hurricane , and the first major hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season , Harvey developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles , reaching tropical storm status on August 17 . The storm crossed through the Windward Islands on the following day , passing just south of Barbados and later near Saint Vincent . Upon entering the Caribbean Sea , Harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear and degenerated into a tropical wave north of Colombia early on August 20 . The remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west - northwestward across the Caribbean and the Yucatán Peninsula , before redeveloping over the Bay of Campeche on August 23 . Harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August 24 , regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day . While the storm moved generally northwest , Harvey 's intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from August 24 -- 25 ; however , Harvey soon resumed strengthening and quickly became a major hurricane and attained Category 4 intensity later that day . Hours later , Harvey made landfall near Rockport , Texas , at peak intensity . Afterwards , rapid weakening ensued , and Harvey had downgraded to a tropical storm as it stalled near the coastline of the state , dropping torrential and unprecedented amounts of rainfall over the Lone Star state . On August 28 , it emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico , strengthening slightly before making a third and final landfall in Louisiana on August 29 . As Harvey drifted inland , it quickly weakened again as it became extratropical on September 1 , before dissipating two days later .

Context: Unlike most Western countries , 18 of the U.S. states do not have a legal minimum age of marriage . Individuals aged 18 have the ability to marry in U.S. states except Nebraska ( 19 ) and Mississippi ( 21 ) . In addition , all states , except Delaware and New Jersey , allow minors to marry in certain circumstances , such as parental consent , judicial consent , pregnancy , or a combination of these situations . Most states allow parties aged 16 and 17 to marry with parental consent alone . In most states , children under 16 can be married too . In the 32 states which have an absolute minimum age set by statute , this age varies between 14 and 18 , while in 18 states there is no statutory minimum age if other legal conditions are met . Although in such states there is no set minimum age by statute , the traditional common law minimum age is 14 for boys and 12 for girls - ages which have been confirmed by case law in some states .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: The term ""lone - pair effect"" is used in chemistry to describe the effect that a pair of unshared electrons has on the electron density of an atom . This effect can influence the molecule 's shape , polarity , and reactivity . Lone pairs are often found on the central atom of a Lewis base , which is a molecule or ion with at least one pair of non - bonding electrons . The presence of lone pairs can lead to changes in the molecule 's shape and polarity . For example, in water ( H2O ) , the two hydrogen atoms are attracted more strongly to the oxygen atom than to each other, causing the molecule to be bent rather than linear. This is due to the presence of a lone pair on the oxygen atom.
Question: what does the lone pair effect refer to in chemistry.

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was .

Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band .

Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life . 
Question: where are genes located what are their functions.

Context: The cell cycle or cell - division cycle is the series of events that take place in a cell leading to its division and duplication of its DNA ( DNA replication ) to produce two daughter cells . In bacteria , which lack a cell nucleus , the cell cycle is divided into the B , C , and D periods . The B period extends from the end of cell division to the beginning of DNA replication . DNA replication occurs during the C period . The D period refers to the stage between the end of DNA replication and the splitting of the bacterial cell into two daughter cells . In cells with a nucleus , as in eukaryotes , the cell cycle is also divided into three periods : interphase , the mitotic ( M ) phase , and cytokinesis . During interphase , the cell grows , accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis , preparing it for a big cell division and duplicating its DNA . During the mitotic phase , the chromosomes separate . During the final stage , cytokinesis , the chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells .

Context: There has been much speculation about what their last song was . A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection .

Context: Social exchange theory goes back to Thibaut and Kelley ( 1959 ) , Kelley and Thibaut ( 1978 ) , Homans ( 1961 ) and Rusbult ( 1983 ) . Sociologist George Homans published a work `` Social Behavior as Exchange '' . He defined social exchange as the exchange of activity , tangible or intangible , and more or less rewarding or costly , between at least two persons . After Homans founded the theory , other theorists continued to write about it , particularly Peter M. Blau and Richard M. Emerson , who in addition to Homans are generally thought of as the major developers of the exchange perspective within sociology . Homans ' work emphasized the individual behavior of actors in interaction with one another . Although there are various modes of exchange , Homans centered his studies on dyadic exchange . John Thibaut and Harold Kelley are recognized for focusing their studies within the theory on the psychological concepts , the dyad and small group . Lévi - Strauss is recognized for contributing to the emergence of this theoretical perspective from his work on anthropology focused on systems of generalized exchange , such as kinship systems and gift exchange .

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: In biology , a gene is a sequence of DNA or RNA that codes for a molecule that has a function . During gene expression , the DNA is first copied into RNA . The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits . These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes . Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be . Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes ( many different genes ) as well as gene -- environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye color or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that constitute life .

Context: A transducer is a device that converts one form of energy into another . It can be electrical to mechanical or mechanical to electrical . An example of the first case would be an ultrasonic range finder , which sends out sound waves and measures how long it takes for them to bounce back from objects in front of the sensor . The second case is exemplified by a hydrophone , which converts acoustic pressure waves into corresponding voltage changes in a wire .

Context: A thylakoid is a membrane - bound compartment inside chloroplasts and cyanobacteria . They are the site of the light - dependent reactions of photosynthesis . Thylakoids consist of a thylakoid membrane surrounding a thylakoid lumen . Chloroplast thylakoids frequently form stacks of disks referred to as grana ( singular : granum ) . Grana are connected by intergranal or stroma thylakoids , which join granum stacks together as a single functional compartment . 
Question: what does the grana do in a plant cell.
Response:Chloroplast thylakoids frequently form stacks of disks referred to as grana. Grana are connected by intergranal or stroma thylakoids, which join granum stacks together as a single functional compartment. Thylakoids are the site of the light - dependent reactions of photosynthesis.

Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .

Context: The First Transcontinental Railroad ( also called the Great Transcontinental Railroad , known originally as the `` Pacific Railroad '' and later as the `` Overland Route '' ) was a 1,912 - mile ( 3,077 km ) continuous railroad line constructed between 1863 and 1869 that connected the existing eastern U.S. rail network at Omaha , Nebraska / Council Bluffs , Iowa with the Pacific coast at the Oakland Long Wharf on San Francisco Bay . The rail line was built by three private companies over public lands provided by extensive US land grants . Construction was financed by both state and US government subsidy bonds as well as by company issued mortgage bonds . The Western Pacific Railroad Company built 132 mi ( 212 km ) of track from Oakland / Alameda to Sacramento , California . The Central Pacific Railroad Company of California ( CPRR ) constructed 690 mi ( 1,110 km ) eastward from Sacramento to Promontory Summit , Utah Territory ( U.T. ) . The Union Pacific built 1,085 mi ( 1,746 km ) from the road 's eastern terminus at Council Bluffs near Omaha , Nebraska westward to Promontory Summit . 
Question: what were the companies that built the transcontinental railroad.
Response:The rail line was built by three private companies: the Western Pacific Railroad Company, the Central Pacific Railroad Company, and the Union Pacific.

Context: With a worldwide box - office gross of over $2.7 billion , Avatar is often proclaimed to be the `` highest - grossing '' film , but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income , which can form a significant portion of a film 's earnings . Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful . Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals , in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters . While complete sales data are not available for Avatar , it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu - ray units in North America , and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu - ray units worldwide . After home video income is accounted for , both films have earned over $3 billion . Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film 's earnings , with a film often earning as much as 20 -- 25 % of its theatrical box - office for a couple of television runs on top of pay - per - view revenues ; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights , equating to about 9 % of its North American gross .
