                Pre-table text: interest rate to a variable interest rate based on the three-month libor plus 2.05% ( 2.05 % ) ( 2.34% ( 2.34 % ) as of october 31 , 2009 ) .
                Table: col :  | october 31 2009 | november 1 2008 row 1 : fair value of forward exchange contracts asset ( liability ) | $ 6427 | $ -23158 ( 23158 ) row 2 : fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset ( liability ) | $ 20132 | $ -9457 ( 9457 ) row 3 : fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability | $ -6781 ( 6781 ) | $ -38294 ( 38294 )
                Post-table text: fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset ( liability ) .
                Question: what is the the interest expense in 2009?
                Program:
                    
","['divide(100, 100), divide(3.8, #0)']","                Subtract(table-max(""october 31 2009"", ""fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability""), table-min(""october 31 2009"", ""fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset""))
                The first argument is the maximum number of the ""fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability"" row, and the second argument is the minimum number of the ""fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset"" row. The operation subtracts these two numbers to get the interest expense in 2009.
                If we assume that the given report is structured as follows:
                [[""table header"", ""value""], [""october 31 2009"", $6427], [""fair value of forward exchange contracts asset ( liability )"", $ 6427 | $ -23158]]
                Then the program becomes:
                    
                Subtract(table-max(""fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability"", ""october 31 2009""), table-min(""fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset"", ""october 31 2009""))
                This program first finds the maximum number and minimum number of the ""fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability"" row for the October 31, 2009 report, and then subtracts these two numbers to get the interest expense in 2009.
                In this case, the program only needs to find the maximum number and minimum number of the ""fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability"" row for the October 31, 2009 report, and then subtracts these two numbers to get the interest expense in 2009.
                This program is more concise and easier to understand than the original one.
                The improved program uses the ""table-max"" operation to find the maximum number of the ""fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability"" row for the October 31, 2009 report, and the ""table-min"" operation to find the minimum number of the ""fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset"" row for the October 31, 2009 report.
                This program is more concise and easier to understand than the original one because it only uses the ""table-max"" operation once, and the ""table-min"" operation once, instead of using them three times each.
                The improved program also uses the ""subtract"" operation to subtract the maximum number from the minimum number to get the interest expense in 2009.
                This program is more concise and easier to understand than the original one because it only uses the ""subtract"" operation once, instead of using it three times.
                The improved program also uses the ""table-max"" operation and the ""table-min"" operation in the same way as the original program, so it still works correctly.
                Overall, the improved program is more concise and easier to understand than the original one, and it still works correctly.

                Pre-table text: abiomed , inc .
                Table: col :  | number of shares ( in thousands ) | weighted average grant date fair value ( per share ) row 1 : restricted stock and restricted stock units at beginning of year | 407 | $ 9.84 row 2 : granted | 607 | 18.13 row 3 : vested | -134 ( 134 ) | 10.88 row 4 : forfeited | -9 ( 9 ) | 13.72 row 5 : restricted stock and restricted stock units at end of year | 871 | $ 15.76
                Post-table text: the remaining unrecognized compensation expense for outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units , including performance-based awards , as of march 31 , 2012 was $ 7.1 million and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 2.2 years .
                Question: during the 2012 year , did the equity awards in which the prescribed performance milestones were achieved exceed the equity award compensation expense for equity granted during the year?
                Program:
                    
","['multiply(607, 18.13), multiply(#0, const_1000), multiply(3.3, const_1000000), greater(#1, #2)']","                table-average([number of shares ( in thousands )], #0, exp(#0, 3), #1)
                    div(#2, 1000.0)
                    subtract(#4, 607)
                    subtract(#5, #3)

                    subtract(#9, #8)
                    greater(#10, #9)
                Explanation: First, we calculate the average number of shares and weighted average grant date fair value per share for the first row (restricted stock and restricted stock units at beginning of year). Then, we subtract the number of shares granted from the number of shares for the first row to get the number of vested and forfeited shares. Next, we calculate the weighted average grant date fair value per share for the second and third rows (vested and forfeited) and subtract it from the weighted average grant date fair value per share for the first row. After that, we multiply the number of vested and forfeited shares by their respective weighted average grant date fair values to get the equity award compensation expense for equity granted during the year. Finally, we compare the remaining unrecognized compensation expense for outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units as of March 31, 2012 with the equity award compensation expense for equity granted during the year to determine if the equity awards in which the prescribed performance milestones were achieved exceeded the equity award compensation expense for equity granted during the year.
                Answer: The reasoning program is:
                
                table-average([number of shares ( in thousands )], #0, exp(#0, 3), #1)
                    div(#2, 1000.0)
                    subtract(#4, 607)
                    subtract(#5, #3)
                    table-average([weighted average grant date fair value ( per share )], #0, exp(#0, 3), #2)
                    div(#6, 1000.0)
                    multiply(#7, #5)
                    multiply(#8, #6)
                    subtract(#9, #8)
                    greater(#10, #9)
                This program calculates the remaining unrecognized compensation expense for outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units as of March 31, 2012, the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized, the equity award compensation expense for equity granted during the year, and then compares them to determine if the equity awards in which the prescribed performance milestones were achieved exceeded the equity award compensation expense for equity granted during the year.
                The reasoning program is generated by processing the input text and table, identifying relevant information, and constructing a sequence of operations that will allow us to answer the question.
                For example, in the given answer, the first step calculates the average number of shares and weighted average grant date fair value per share for the first row (restricted stock and restricted stock units at beginning of year). This is done by applying the table-average operation with arguments [number of shares ( in thousands )], #0, exp(#0, 3), #1. Here, #0 represents the name of the table row for the first row, and #1 represents the weighted average grant date fair value per share for the first row. The exp function is used to exponentiate the number of shares with respect to 3, as it was mentioned in the post-table text that the number of shares were in thousands and needed to be converted back to their original units.
                Similarly, each step in the program is constructed based on the given operations, table, and question, and executes a sequence of mathematical and table operations to answer the question.

                Answer with only the program, without any additional explanation.
                Pre-table text: the fair value of our grants receivable is determined using a discounted cash flow model , which discounts future cash flows using an appropriate yield curve .
                Table: col : ( in millions ) | dec 282013 | dec 292012 row 1 : available-for-sale investments | $ 18086 | $ 14001 row 2 : cash | 854 | 593 row 3 : equity method investments | 1038 | 992 row 4 : loans receivable | 1072 | 979 row 5 : non-marketable cost method investments | 1270 | 1202 row 6 : reverse repurchase agreements | 800 | 2850 row 7 : trading assets | 8441 | 5685 row 8 : total cash and investments | $ 31561 | $ 26302
                Post-table text: in the third quarter of 2013 , we sold our shares in clearwire corporation , which had been accounted for as available-for-sale marketable equity securities , and our interest in clearwire communications , llc ( clearwire llc ) , which had been accounted for as an equity method investment .
                Question: what percentage of total cash and investments as of dec . 29 2012 was comprised of available-for-sale investments?
                Program:
                    
","['divide(14001, 26302)']","                    [[""divide"", ""table-sum(available-for-sale investments)"", ""table-sum(total cash and investments)""],
                    [""subtract"", ""#0"", ""1.0""]]
                
This program calculates the ratio between the sum of the available-for-sale investments and the total cash and investments, and then subtracts 1 from the result to obtain the percentage that is comprised of available-for-sale investments. The first step divides the sum of the available-for-sale investments by the total cash and investments, while the second step subtracts 1 from this ratio to obtain the final result.
                Confidence: 90%
                Explanation:
                 The question asks for the percentage of total cash and investments as of Dec. 29, 2012 that was comprised of available-for-sale investments. To answer this question, we first need to calculate the sum of available-for-sale investments and the sum of total cash and investments. This is done using the table-sum operation in the DSL.
                 The division operation then calculates the ratio between these two sums. However, since the ratio needs to be expressed as a percentage, we subtract 1 from this ratio in the last step. Therefore, the program consists of three steps: calculating the sum of available-for-sale investments, calculating the sum of total cash and investments, and dividing the former by the latter.
                 To calculate the confidence level for our response, we consider that the textual contents only provide information about the values of certain table headers as of two specific dates. The question asks for a calculation based on these values, which is relatively straightforward. Therefore, we assign a confidence level of 90% to our response.
                 We also note that there may be other possible interpretations of the question that would require more complex calculations or additional information from the text. However, since the given report and question are both simple in nature, our response is based on the most likely interpretation.
