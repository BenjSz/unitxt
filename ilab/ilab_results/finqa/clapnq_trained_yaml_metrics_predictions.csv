Context: The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four . Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum .
