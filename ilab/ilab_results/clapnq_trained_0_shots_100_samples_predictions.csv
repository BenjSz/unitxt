Context: Seasonality is a characteristic of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes which recur every calendar year . Any predictable change or pattern in a time series that recurs or repeats over a one - year period can be said to be seasonal . It is common in many situations -- such as grocery store or even in a Medical Examiner 's office -- that the demand depends on the day of the week . In such situations , the forecasting procedure calculates the seasonal index of the `` season '' -- seven seasons , one for each day -- which is the ratio of the average demand of that season ( which is calculated by Moving Average or Exponential Smoothing using historical data corresponding only to that season ) to the average demand across all seasons . An index higher than 1 indicates that demand is higher than average ; an index less than 1 indicates that the demand is less than the average . 
Question: which method of forecasting uses averages to predict future weather.

Context: Because the prime minister is , in practice , the most politically powerful member of the Canadian government , he or she is sometimes erroneously referred to as Canada 's head of state , when , in fact , that post is held by the Canadian monarch , represented by the governor general . The prime minister is , instead , the head of government and is responsible for advising the Crown on how to exercise the Royal Prerogative and its executive powers , which are governed by the constitution and its conventions . However , the function of the prime minister has evolved with increasing power . Today , as per the doctrines of constitutional monarchy , the advice given by the prime minister is ordinarily binding , meaning the prime minister effectively carries out those duties ascribed to the sovereign or governor general , leaving the latter to act in predominantly ceremonial fashions . As such , the prime minister , supported by the Office of the Prime Minister ( PMO ) , controls the appointments of many key figures in Canada 's system of governance , including the governor general , the Cabinet , justices of the Supreme Court , senators , heads of crown corporations , ambassadors to foreign countries , the provincial lieutenant governors , and approximately 3,100 other positions .

Context: Insulin ( from Latin insula , island ) is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreatic islets ; it is considered to be the main anabolic hormone of the body . It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates , fats and protein by promoting the absorption of , especially glucose from the blood into liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells . In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen via glycogenesis or fats ( triglycerides ) via lipogenesis , or , in the case of the liver , into both . Glucose production and secretion by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood . Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues . It is therefore an anabolic hormone , promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules inside the cells . Low insulin levels in the blood have the opposite effect by promoting widespread catabolism , especially of reserve body fat .

Context: Frank was a prolific author , writing 40 books . He published widely on political economy , economic history , international relations , historical sociology , and world history . Perhaps his most notable work is Capitalism and Underdevelopment in Latin America . Published in 1967 , it was one of the formative texts in dependency theory . In his later career he produced works such as ReOrient : Global Economy in the Asian Age and , with Barry Gills , The World System : Five Hundred Years or Five Thousand . Frank 's theories center on the idea that a nation 's economic strength , largely determined by historical circumstances -- especially geography -- dictates its global power . He is also well known for suggesting that purely export oriented solutions to development create imbalances detrimental to poor countries . Frank has made significant contributions to the world - systems theory ( which , according to him , should be rather called the World System one ) . He has argued that a World System was formed no later than in the 4th millennium BC ; his argument contrasts sharply with the scholarly majority who posit beginnings in the `` long 16th century '' ( a position held , for example , by Immanuel Wallerstein ) . Frank also insisted that the idea of numerous `` world - systems '' did not make much sense ( indeed , if there are many `` world - systems '' in the world , then they simply do not deserve to be called `` world - systems '' ) , and we should rather speak about one single World System .

Context: A likely and documented explanation is that the term is derived from the `` dead horse '' ritual of seamen ( see Beating a dead horse ) . In this practice , the seaman paraded a straw - stuffed effigy of a horse around the deck before throwing it overboard . Seamen were paid partly in advance before a long voyage , and they frequently spent their pay all at once , resulting in a period of time without income . If they got advances from the ship 's paymaster , they would incur debt . This period was called the `` dead horse '' time , and it usually lasted a month or two . The seaman 's ceremony was to celebrate having worked off the `` dead horse '' debt .

Context: The main purpose of a myelin sheath is to increase the speed at which impulses propagate along the myelinated fiber . Along unmyelinated fibers , impulses continuously move as waves , but , in myelinated fibers , they `` hop '' or propagate by saltatory conduction . Myelin decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance across the cell membrane ( the axolemma ) . Thus , myelination prevents the electric current from leaving the axon . It has been suggested that myelin permits larger body size by maintaining agile communication between distant body parts .

Bronck became the first recorded European settler in the area now known as the Bronx and built a farm named `` Emmanus '' close to what today is the corner of Willis Avenue and 132nd Street in Mott Haven . He leased land from the Dutch West India Company on the neck of the mainland immediately north of the Dutch settlement in Harlem ( on Manhattan Island ) , and bought additional tracts from the local tribes . He eventually accumulated 500 acres ( 200 ha ) between the Harlem River and the Aquahung , which became known as Bronck 's River or the Bronx ( River ) . Dutch and English settlers referred to the area as Bronck 's Land . The American poet William Bronk was a descendant of Pieter Bronck , either Jonas Bronck 's son or his younger brother .

Because of this , the diffusion of both movable - type systems was , to some degree , limited to primarily East Asia , although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries , traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe . Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others . Around 1450 Johannes Gutenberg , introduced the metal movable - type printing press in Europe , along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould . The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor . Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead , tin , and antimony -- and these materials remained standard for 550 years .

Context: In economics , tax incidence or tax burden is the analysis of the effect of a particular tax on the distribution of economic welfare . The introduction of a tax drives a wedge between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive for a product , which typically imposes an economic burden on both producers and consumers . The concept was brought to attention by the French Physiocrats , in particular François Quesnay , who argued that the incidence of all taxation falls ultimately on landowners and is at the expense of land rent . Tax incidence is said to `` fall '' upon the group that ultimately bears the burden of , or ultimately has to pay , the tax . The key concept is that the tax incidence or tax burden does not depend on where the revenue is collected , but on the price elasticity of demand and price elasticity of supply .

Soon after , Thomas Carr of the Carr Music Store in Baltimore published the words and music together under the title `` The Star Spangled Banner '' , although it was originally called `` Defence of Fort M'Henry '' . Thomas Carr 's arrangement introduced the raised fourth which became the standard deviation from `` The Anacreontic Song '' .

Context: Ballard realized that looking for the wreck itself using sonar was unlikely to be successful and adopted a different tactic , drawing on the experience of the surveys of Thresher and Scorpion ; he would look for the debris field instead , using Argo 's cameras rather than sonar . Whereas sonar could not distinguish man - made debris on the sea bed from natural objects , cameras could . The debris field would also be a far bigger target , stretching a mile ( 1.6 km ) or longer , whereas Titanic itself was only 90 feet ( 27 m ) wide . The search required round - the - clock towing of Argo back and forth above the sea bed , with shifts of watchers aboard the research vessel Knorr looking at the camera pictures for any sign of debris . After a week of fruitless searching , at 12.48 am on Sunday 1 September 1985 pieces of debris began to appear on Knorr 's screens . One of them was identified as a boiler , identical to those shown in pictures from 1911 . The following day , the main part of the wreck was found and Argo sent back the first pictures of Titanic since her sinking 73 years before . The discovery made headlines around the world .

It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . During most of its existence , the empire was the most powerful economic , cultural , and military force in Europe .

Context: Each canal is filled with a fluid called endolymph and contains motion sensors within the fluids . At the base of each canal , the bony region of the canal is enlarged which opens into the utricle and has a dilated sac at one end called the osseous ampullae . Within the ampulla is a mound of hair cells and supporting cells called crista ampullaris . These hair cells have many cytoplasmic projections on the apical surface called stereocilia which are embedded in a gelatinous structure called the cupula . As the head rotates the duct moves but the endolymph lags behind owing to inertia . This deflects the cupula and bends the stereocilia within . The bending of these stereocilia alters an electric signal that is transmitted to the brain . Within approximately 10 seconds of achieving constant motion , the endolymph catches up with the movement of the duct and the cupula is no longer affected , stopping the sensation of acceleration . The specific gravity of the cupula is comparable to that of the surrounding endolymph . Consequently , the cupula is not displaced by gravity , unlike the otolithic membranes of the utricle and saccule . As with macular hair cells , hair cells of the crista ampullaris will depolarise when the stereocilia deflect towards the kinocilium . Deflection in the opposite direction results in hyperpolarisation and inhibition . In the horizontal canal , ampullopetal flow is necessary for hair - cell stimulation , whereas ampullofugal flow is necessary in the anterior and posterior canals .

Context: The mining of minerals in Nigeria accounts for only 0.3 % of its GDP , due to the influence of its vast oil resources . The domestic mining industry is underdeveloped , leading to Nigeria having to import minerals that it could produce domestically , such as salt or iron ore . Rights to ownership of mineral resources is held by the Federal government of Nigeria , which grants titles to organizations to explore , mine , and sell mineral resources . Organized mining began in 1903 when the Mineral Survey of the Northern Protectorates was created by the British colonial government . A year later , the Mineral Survey of the Southern Protectorates was founded . By the 1940s , Nigeria was a major producer of tin , columbite , and coal . The discovery of oil in 1956 hurt the mineral extraction industries , as government and industry both began to focus on this new resource . The Nigerian Civil War in the late 1960s led many expatriate mining experts to leave the country . Mining regulation is handled by the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development , which oversees the management of all mineral resources . Mining law is codified in the Federal Minerals and Mining Act of 1999 . Historically , Nigeria 's mining industry was monopolized by state - owned public corporations . This led to a decline in productivity in almost all mineral industries . The Obasanjo administration began a process of selling off government - owned corporations to private investors in 1999 .

Context: Unlike per capita GDP or standard of living , both of which can be measured in financial terms , it is harder to make objective or long - term measurements of the quality of life experienced by nations or other groups of people . Researchers have begun in recent times to distinguish two aspects of personal well - being : Emotional well - being , in which respondents are asked about the quality of their everyday emotional experiences -- the frequency and intensity of their experiences of , for example , joy , stress , sadness , anger , and affection -- and life evaluation , in which respondents are asked to think about their life in general and evaluate it against a scale . Such and other systems and scales of measurement have been in use for some time . Research has attempted to examine the relationship between quality of life and productivity . There are many different methods of measuring quality of life in terms of health care , wealth and materialistic goods . However , it is much more difficult to measure meaningful expression of one 's desires . One way to do so is to evaluate the scope of how individuals have fulfilled their own ideals . Quality of life can simply mean happiness , the subjective state of mind .

Context: Players who are not drafted in a league 's annual draft of amateur players are considered to be unrestricted free agents and are free to sign contracts with any team . In most North American professional sports , players are drafted by sequencing each team from worst to best ( according to the teams ' immediately preceding season record , sometimes invoking a draft lottery factor to avoid having teams intentionally lose their last games to gain higher draft position ) and allowing said teams to claim rights to the top players entering the league that year . Players that pass through an entire draft ( usually several rounds ) without being selected by any of the league 's teams become unrestricted free agents , and these players are sometimes identified simply as an undrafted free agent ( UDFA ) or undrafted sportsperson and are free to sign with any team they choose . The term `` undrafted free agent '' is most common in the National Football League , where rookies enter directly into the NFL and do not play in a minor league system . It can also occasionally be seen in the National Hockey League , which increasingly uses college hockey as a source ; the NHL Entry Draft usually drafts players during high school age ( i.e. , junior leagues ) , which allows overlooked players who excel at the college level or in European professional leagues to bypass the draft and sign directly with the NHL .

In bacteria , which lack a cell nucleus , the cell cycle is divided into the B , C , and D periods . The B period extends from the end of cell division to the beginning of DNA replication . DNA replication occurs during the C period . The D period refers to the stage between the end of DNA replication and the splitting of the bacterial cell into two daughter cells . In cells with a nucleus , as in eukaryotes , the cell cycle is also divided into three periods : interphase , the mitotic ( M ) phase , and cytokinesis . During interphase , the cell grows , accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis , preparing it for a big cell division and duplicating its DNA . During the mitotic phase , the chromosomes separate .

Sociologist George Homans published a work `` Social Behavior as Exchange '' . He defined social exchange as the exchange of activity , tangible or intangible , and more or less rewarding or costly , between at least two persons . After Homans founded the theory , other theorists continued to write about it , particularly Peter M. Blau and Richard M. Emerson , who in addition to Homans are generally thought of as the major developers of the exchange perspective within sociology . Homans ' work emphasized the individual behavior of actors in interaction with one another . Although there are various modes of exchange , Homans centered his studies on dyadic exchange . John Thibaut and Harold Kelley are recognized for focusing their studies within the theory on the psychological concepts , the dyad and small group . Lévi - Strauss is recognized for contributing to the emergence of this theoretical perspective from his work on anthropology focused on systems of generalized exchange , such as kinship systems and gift exchange .
