    \ office .\nWorkers also told not to talk to reporters or Government Accountability\
    \ Office .\nWatchdog group calls e-mail a \"gag order\"; EPA official says it's\
    \ not about secrecy .\nTuesday news conference to address whether EPA avoided\

  "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Environmental Protection Agency advised employees\
    \ last month not to answer questions from journalists, the Government Accountability\
    \ Office or the agency's inspector general, according to an EPA e-mail made public\
    \ Monday. California Sen. Barbara Boxer has said the EPA is becoming a \"secretive,\
    \ dangerous ally of polluters.\" \"Please do not respond to questions or make\
    \ any statements,\" the June 16 e-mail said, advising staff to direct questioners\
    \ to senior staff members cleared to answer questions from outside the agency.\
    \ Robbi Farrell, chief of staff of the EPA's compliance assurance division, sent\
    \ the e-mail to 11 managers in the department. The e-mail was posted on a Web\
    \ site of the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. The group, an\
    \ alliance of state and federal environmental professionals, labeled the communication\
    \ a \"gag order.\" \"The order reinforces a growing bunker mentality within an\
    \ EPA that is the subject of a growing number of probes into political interference\
    \ with agency operations,\" the group said. EPA press director Roxanne Smith rejected\
    \ that characterization, saying the e-mail was about efficiency, not secrecy.\
    \ The memo was a response to a May 2007 audit by the Inspector General's Office\
    \ that found the EPA did not respond earlier to IG reports on problems with water\
    \ enforcement and other issues, The Associated Press reported. The audit, however,\
    \ did not make any recommendations governing communication between staff and the\
    \ Inspector General's Office. \"A senior staffer in the enforcement office sent\
    \ out an e-mail to simply help her office efficiently respond to requests from\
    \ the press, GAO and EPA's inspector general,\" Smith told CNN. \"There is nothing\
    \ in the procedure that restricts conversation between enforcement staff, the\
    \ press, GAO and the IG,\" she said, adding it is \"consistent with existing agency\
    \ polices.\" Smith is one of the people to whom recipients of the memo were told\
    \ to direct journalists' questions. In a written statement, the EPA's Office of\
    \ Inspector General said it did not approve the language of Robbi's warning and\
    \ advised, \"All EPA officials and employees are required to cooperate\" with\
    \ the office. \"This cooperation includes providing the OIG full and unrestricted\
    \ access to EPA documents, records, and personnel,\" the statement read. \"We\
    \ are currently engaged in discussions with OECA [Office of Enforcement and Compliance\
    \ Assurance] to assure that OIG and OECA interpretations are consistent in this\
    \ matter.\" And Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who has long battled\
    \ with the agency's administrator, Stephen Johnson, said the instructions showed\
    \ that Johnson is \"turning the EPA into a secretive, dangerous ally of polluters,\
    \ instead of a leader in the effort to protect the health and safety of the American\
    \ people.\" Last week, Johnson denied a request to appear before two Senate committees\
    \ to talk about whether the EPA's decisions comply with its staff's legal and\
    \ technical recommendations. The committee's chairman, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont,\
    \ has asked the inspector general's office to assess the administration's claims\
    \ of executive privilege as it tries to keep documents related to EPA decisions\
    \ from Congress. Boxer chairs the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public\
    \ Works. She is expected to hold a news conference Tuesday to talk about what\
    \ she calls \"political interference in recent EPA decisions\" and discuss \"\
    apparent contradictions between the sworn testimony\" of Johnson and accounts\
    \ given by other sworn witnesses."

  "answer": "22-year-old arms dealer faces congressional inquiry .\nCompany supplied\
    \ ammunition made in China decades ago .\nCompany's contract called for bullets\
    \ made in Hungary .\nGrandfather says dealer, 22, had \"gift\" for weaponry ."
  "context": "(CNN) -- Efraim Diveroli's father hoped his son would become a doctor\
    \ or lawyer. Efraim Diveroli, 22, is doing his \"patriotic\" duty as an arms dealer,\
    \ his grandfather says. What he got instead is a 22-year-old international arms\
    \ dealer who faces a congressional inquiry for allegedly selling old Chinese ammunition\
    \ to the U.S. military to equip allies in Afghanistan. Diveroli is president of\
    \ AEY Inc., a South Florida company which, according to U.S. government documents,\
    \ has done more than $10 million of business with the U.S. government since 2004.\
    \ The papers also reveal the company struck it big in 2007 with contracts totaling\
    \ more than $200 million to supply ammunition, assault rifles and other weapons\
    \ to the Afghan National Army and police. The company's contract said it would\
    \ get the ammunition from Hungary. But Army investigators found what the Afghan\
    \ military got included corroded ammunition made in China as long as 46 years\
    \ ago. The New York Times reported Thursday that AEY shopped stockpiles and ammo\
    \ dumps in old Soviet bloc allies, from Albania to Kazakhstan. Albania was a big\
    \ customer for Chinese armaments in the 1960s and '70s, the Times reported. Angelo\
    \ Diveroli, Efraim's grandfather, told CNN affiliate WPLG-TV that his grandson\
    \ is being targeted by \"jealous competitors\" in the international arms market.\
    \ Since he was a boy, the grandfather said, Efraim Diveroli has known his way\
    \ around weapons. Read the WPLG story . \"He's a genius about anything to do with\
    \ weapons,\" the 72-year-old says. \"Ever since he was a little boy, I would take\
    \ him to gun shows and he could identify every model of guns. People would ask:\
    \ How can he do that so young? He has a gift, I would tell them.'' Michael Diveroli,\
    \ Efraim's father, told CNN affiliate WFOR-TV that he wished his son had turned\
    \ his intellect elsewhere. He said Efraim was \"a boy genius\" who is \"hard to\
    \ control.\" Read the WFOR story . \"I would prefer he became a nice Jewish doctor\
    \ or lawyer rather than an arms dealer,\" WFOR quoted Michael Diveroli as saying.\
    \  Watch how father says son runs his own show \xBB . But his son seem to have\
    \ a good idea of the circles he was running in. \"What goes on in the Albanian\
    \ Defense Ministry,\" the New York Times quoted him as saying. \"Who's clean?\
    \ Who's dirty? Don't want to know about it.\" On a MySpace page Efraim Diveroli\
    \ last updated in 2005, he says \"I probably grew up way to (sic) fast.\" But\
    \ in a hint of where the then-19-year-old's future was heading, he wrote, \"I\
    \ definately (sic) have the desire to be very successful in my business and this\
    \ does take up alot (sic) of my time.\" The MySpace page also hints of his need\
    \ for thrills. \"I'm one of those guys who needs to be entertained and having\
    \ lots of fun all the time so if your (sic) also an undiagnosed case of ADD look\
    \ me up,\" it says. He lists the weapon-heavy films \"Heat\" and \"Scarface\"\
    \ among his favorites. A CNN search of Diveroli's Florida criminal record shows\
    \ arrests, but no convictions, on offenses from misdemeanor battery to felony\
    \ possession of stolen property. He has yet to appear in court on a March 3 arrest\
    \ for driving under the influence. For now, relatives say Efraim Diveroli is out\
    \ of the country. CNN attempts to contact him have not been successful. His grandfather\
    \ told WPLG that Diveroli is now in Turkey or Albania doing his \"patriotic\"\
    \ duty. \"He's all over the world getting what the military needs,\" Angelo Diveroli\
    \ says. But in a MySpace message exchange with Radar magazine, a person thought\
    \ to be David Packouz, a 25-year-old who was AEY's vice president, refers to Efraim\
    \ Diveroli as \"my former scumbag partner\" and says he is motivated by money.\
    \ \"Efraim Diveroli has a serious psychological illness called 'extreme greed,'\
    \ \" Radar quotes him as writing in a report on its Web site. Packouz would not\
    \ discuss AEY with CNN on Friday, saying he had no comment \"because of the ongoing\

  "answer": "NEW: British mercenary Simon Mann jailed for plotting a Equatorial Guinea\
    \ coup .\nMann testified he was \"junior\" in organization that plotted attempted\
    \ coup .\nMann implicated former friend Mark Thatcher in 2004 plot during testimony\
    \ ."
  "context": "(CNN) -- British mercenary Simon Mann has been jailed for 34 years for\
    \ his part in plotting a coup in Equatorial Guinea. Simon Mann was arrested after\
    \ a plane carrying him and about 60 mercenaries landed in Zimbabwe. The former\
    \ British military officer confessed to trying to topple long-time ruler Teodoro\
    \ Obiang Nguema Mbasogo - but denied being the plot's leader. The goal of the\
    \ plot was to install exiled opposition leader Severo Moto who is currently in\
    \ Spain awaiting trial on charges of arms trafficking, and to gain access to the\
    \ former Spanish colony's oil wealth. During the trial, Mann testified he was\
    \ a \"junior\" in the organization which plotted to overthrow the tiny west African\
    \ country's president in 2004, and that Lebanese businessman Eli Calil was the\
    \ man in charge. \"Eli Calil was known as the cardinal -- the cardinal -- which\
    \ I think says it all,\" Mann told the court.  Watch Mann's reaction to his sentences\
    \ \xBB . Footage of the proceedings was broadcast by Britain's Channel 4 News,\
    \ which says it has the only camera in the courtroom. As Mann's trial progressed\
    \ last month, South Africa rejected Mann's allegation that it had given its tacit\
    \ support for the coup plot. \"South Africa will never, tacitly or expressly,\
    \ support the use of mercenaries to bring about fundamental political changes\
    \ in any country in our continent or elsewhere in the world including Equatorial\
    \ Guinea,\" the government said in a statement. Mann testified that several governments,\
    \ including Spain and the United States, welcomed the idea of a coup. Mann is\
    \ a former British army commando who was arrested four years ago after a plane\
    \ carrying him and about 60 mercenaries landed in Zimbabwe. The government of\
    \ Equatorial Guinea said the group was on its way to overthrow its president.\
    \ Mann said at the time they were going to guard a diamond mine in the Democratic\
    \ Republic of Congo. A Zimbabwe court convicted Mann of trying to buy weapons\
    \ illegally. He served four years in jail there before being extradited to Equatorial\
    \ Guinea's capital of Malabo earlier this year to face charges of leading an abortive\
    \ coup. Mann testified that his former friend Mark Thatcher -- the son of former\
    \ British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher -- was a main partner in the plot.\
    \ Thatcher was arrested along with Mann in 2004, and he pleaded guilty in South\
    \ Africa the following year to unwittingly bankrolling the plot. He escaped jail\
    \ time by paying a fine. Thatcher admitted giving $275,000 toward the charter\
    \ of a helicopter, saying he thought was for commercial purposes and discovered\
    \ only later it was to be used by mercenaries. But Mann said Thatcher paid $350,000\
    \ for a helicopter and a plane which he knew would be used in the plot, and that\
    \ he attended meetings about the plan with Calil in London. Calil, Mann said,\
    \ initially asked him to assassinate President Obiang and talked about the possibility\
    \ of staging a guerrilla war. Mann testified he refused both requests, considering\
    \ them unethical, but he did agree to help stage a coup. Though he said Thatcher\
    \ was a top figure in the plot, Mann testified that even Thatcher was under Calil\
    \ in the group's hierarchy. Mann, appearing in a gray prison outfit, emphasized\
    \ that he was not the man in charge. Mann's defense lawyer took 45 minutes to\
    \ question Mann, Channel 4 reported, in contrast to the four hours of prosecution\
    \ questioning Mann faced. Mann smiled often in the footage shown by Channel 4\
    \ and even stuck his tongue out playfully at the camera. After his stint in the\
    \ British army, Mann was affiliated with the South Africa-based mercenary firm\
    \ Executive Outcomes. The firm described itself on its now-defunct Web site as\
    \ a \"military advisory service\" that had played a \"crucial\" role in ending\
    \ two African civil wars."
