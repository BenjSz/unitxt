- "question": "Please respond to the following question using the context\nContext:\
    \ The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system , and with\
    \ the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system . The brain consists of\
    \ the cerebrum , the brainstem and the cerebellum . It controls most of the activities\
    \ of the body , processing , integrating , and coordinating the information it\
    \ receives from the sense organs , and making decisions as to the instructions\
    \ sent to the rest of the body . The brain is contained in , and protected by\
    \ , the skull bones of the head . The cerebrum is the largest part of the human\
    \ brain . It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres . The cerebral cortex is\
    \ an outer layer of grey matter , covering the core of white matter . The cortex\
    \ is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex . The neocortex\
    \ is made up of six neuronal layers , while the allocortex has three or four .\
    \ Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes -- the frontal , temporal\
    \ , parietal , and occipital lobes . The frontal lobe is associated with executive\
    \ functions including self - control , planning , reasoning , and abstract thought\
    \ , while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision . Within each lobe , cortical\
    \ areas are associated with specific functions , such as the sensory , motor and\
    \ association regions . Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar\
    \ in shape and function , some functions are associated with one side , such as\
    \ language in the left and visual - spatial ability in the right . The hemispheres\
    \ are connected by nerve tracts , the largest being the corpus callosum . \nQuestion:\
    \ what is the function of the human brain.\nResponse:"
  "answer": "The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, and\
    \ with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system. \r\nIt controls most\
    \ of the activities of the body, processing, integrating, and coordinating the\
    \ information it receives from the sense organs, and making decisions as to the\
